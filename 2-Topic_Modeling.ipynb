Stromal-vascular cells were isolated from i.m. and s.c. fat depots of 3 Angus steers and propagated in culture. Cells were exposed to differentiation media containing 0.25 μM dexamethasone (DEX), a glucocorticoid analog, and 40 μM troglitazone (TRO), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist, or both. Cells treated with DEX and TRO had greater (P &lt; 0.02) glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity than control cells. No interactions between DEX, TRO, and depot (P &gt; 0.59) or depot differences (P = 0.41) in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity were found. Morphological assessment of adipogenic colonies showed that DEX induced a 1.8-fold increase in the percentage of adipogenic colonies (P = 0.03), whereas TRO increased the proportion of adipogenic colonies by 1.9-fold (P = 0.02) compared with those not treated with DEX or TRO, respectively. Depots had a similar percentage of adipogenic colonies (P = 0.18); however, the percentage of differentiated cells within adipogenic colonies was found to be 6.4-fold greater in s.c. isolates compared with i.m. (P &lt; 0.001). Addition of TRO increased the proportion of differentiated cells within colonies by 10-fold compared with those of nontreated colonies (P &lt; 0.001), whereas the percentage of differentiated cells within adipogenic colonies only tended to be increased by DEX (P = 0.10). These data indicate that bovine i.m. and s.c. S-V cells are capable of enhanced differentiation in response to DEX and TRO, and these effects were additive. Most importantly, inherent differences in the capacity to differentiate exist between adipogenic bovine i.m. and s.c. S-V cells.'),\n",

Extracellular matrix derived from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) cells or tumors enhanced several aspects of adipogenesis in vitro. In comparison to uncoated and fibronectin substrata, EHS-ECM substratum markedly increased attachment, spreading, and hypertrophy of preadipocytes while antagonizing spreading of non-preadipocytes. In addition, adipocyte number increased (P &lt; .05) on these substrata despite no increase in total cell number: this resulted in a greater (P &lt; .05) proportion of preadipocytes. These effects of EHS-ECM were also observed with laminin substrata per se, whereas types I and IV collagen and fibronectin had no influence. In contrast to all other substrata, adipocyte number decreased and total cell number increased 2.5-fold on ECM derived from corneal endothelial cells; this resulted in the lowest proportion of preadipocytes. Challenging cultures with adipogenic media (+serum) did not counter the inhibitory influence of corneal endothelial ECM, whereas dexamethasone partially neutralized the inhibitory influence of this ECM. These studies clearly show that source or type of the ECM dictated the influence of ECM substrata on preadipocyte development in primary S-V cultures.

       "'Mastitis, an inflammatory reaction of the mammary gland that is usually caused by a microbial infection, is recognized as the most costly disease in dairy cattle. Decreased milk production accounts for approximately 70% of the total cost of mastitis. Mammary tissue damage reduces the number and activity of epithelial cells and consequently contributes to decreased milk production. Mammary tissue damage has been shown to be induced by either apoptosis or necrosis. These 2 distinct types of cell death can be distinguished by morphological, biochemical, and molecular changes in dying cells. Both bacterial factors and host immune reactions contribute to epithelial tissue damage. During infection of the mammary glands, the tissue damage can initially be caused by bacteria and their products. Certain bacteria produce toxins that destroy cell membranes and damage milk-producing tissue, whereas other bacteria are able to invade and multiply within the bovine mammary epithelial cells before causing cell death. In addition, mastitis is characterized by an influx of somatic cells, primarily polymorphonuclear neutrophils, into the mammary gland. With more immune cells migrating into the mammary gland and the breakdown of the blood-milk barrier, damage to the mammary epithelium worsens. It is well known that breakdown of the extracellular matrix can lead to death of the epithelial cells. Meanwhile, polymorphonuclear neutrophils can harm the mammary tissue by releasing reactive oxygen intermediates and proteolytic enzymes. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the use of antioxidants and other protective compounds in mastitis control programs is worth investigating, because they may aid in alleviating damage to secretory cells and thus reduce subsequent milk loss.'"

       "  'Tendon injuries affect all levels of athletic horses and represent a significant loss to the equine industry. Accumulation of microdamage within the tendon architecture leads to formation of core lesions. Traditional approaches to tendon repair are based on an initial period of rest to limit the inflammatory process followed by a controlled reloading program designed to promote the maturation and linear arrangement of scar tissue within the lesion. However, these treatment protocols are inefficient, resulting in prolonged recovery periods and frequent recurrence. Current alternative therapies include the use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) and a population of nucleated cells from adipose containing adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC). Umbilical cord blood-derived stem cells (UCB) have recently received attention for their increased plasticity in vitro and potential as a therapeutic aid. Both BMSC and AdMSC require expansion in culture before implantation to obtain a pure stem cell population, limiting the time frame for implantation. Collected at parturition, UCB can be cryopreserved for future use. Furthermore, the low immunogenicity of the UCB population allows for allogeneic implantation. Current research indicates that BMSC, AdMSC, and UCB can differentiate into tenocyte-like cells in vitro, increasing expression of scleraxis, tenascin c, and extracellular matrix proteins. When implanted, BMSC and AdMSC engraft into the tendon and improve tendon architecture. However, treatment with these stem cells does not decrease recovery period. Furthermore, the resulting regeneration is not optimal, as the resulting tissue is still inferior to native tendon. Umbilical cord blood-derived stem cells may provide an alternate source of stem cells that promote improved regeneration of tendon tissue. A more naïve cell population, these cells may have a greater rate of engraftment as well as an increased ability to secrete bioactive factors and recruit additional reparative cells. Further work should clarify the role of distinct stem cell sources in the regenerating tendon and the need for a naïve or differentiated cell type for implantation.'),\n",

Stromal-vascular cells isolated from i.m., s.c., and p.r. adipose tissues of 2 steers were propagated in culture and exposed to 0 or 250 nM DEX for 48 h. Cell lysates were subjected to GR immunoblot analysis, and immunoreactive protein bands of ~97, ~62, and ~48 kDa were detected and expressed relative to β-actin immunoreactivity. The abundance of each GR immunoreactive protein was similar among S-V cell populations (P &gt; 0.50). Dexamethasone exposure decreased the abundance of the ~97 and ~62 kDa GR immunoreactive bands in S-V cells from the 3 depots (P &lt; 0.001), but did not affect the expression of the ~48 kDa band (P = 0.96). Stromal-vascular cells isolated from 3 steers were grown in culture, and upon confluence, were exposed to 0, 25, or 2,500 nM DEX for 48 h. After an additional 10 d in differentiation media, differentiation was determined by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) specific activity and oil red O staining. The extent of differentiation differed by depot (p.r. &gt; s.c. &gt; i.m.; P &lt; 0.05). Compared with control, 2,500 nM DEX increased GPDH activity in S-V cells from all depots (P &lt; 0.05), and no interaction between depot and DEX concentration was observed (P = 0.99). We observed an adipose tissue depot by DEX concentration interaction (P = 0.03) for S-V cells with large (≥10 μm-diameter) lipid droplets. The percentage of p.r. S-V cells with large lipid droplets increased in response to DEX in a linear manner (P &lt; 0.02), but only increased greater than control in s.c. cells exposed to 2,500 nM DEX (P = 0.002). Dexamethasone did not significantly increase the percentage of i.m. S-V cells with large lipid droplets (P &gt; 0.27).

Urease prepared from jackbean meal was injected intraperitoneally in Trials I and III, while Sigma urease type II powder was used in Trial II. Starting doses ranged from 0.1 to 10 modified Sumner units per pound of body weight with from 6 to 12 injections increasing by arithmetic progression. A corn-soybean ration fortified with minerals and vitamins was fed.Gain and feed efficiency of immunized pigs were not improved in Trials II and III; however, there was some improvement in Trial I at the 10-unit level. Plasma urea N levels did not differ significantly between treatments in any of the trials. In general, ammonia N levels of plasma were not different between treatments; however, the 0.5-unit level (low) in Trial III significantly reduced plasma ammonia levels during the latter part of the trial. Urease immunization was effective in stimulating antibody production (antiurease) and in reducing intestinal urease activity. In general, all levels of urease injected were equally effective in producing antiurease with some evidence of partial inhibition of antibody production at the higher urease levels. Urease immunization appeared to have no effect on the utilization of urea by the pig. Higher urea N levels and lower ammonia N levels were observed in pigs fed rations with added urea. Gain, feed intake and feed efficiency were decreased when more than 35% of dietary N from soybean meal was replaced with urea.'),\n",

Heifers were fed complete diets containing 1.2% urea as the only source of supplemental N. Infusion treatments were: (1) control (C): 2 liters water/24 h; (2) arginine (Arg): 24.00 g arginine*HC1 in 2 liters water/24 h; (3) ammonium acetate (NH4Ac): 116.34 g ammonium acetate in 2 liters water/24 h; (4) arginine plus ammonium acetate (Arg + NH4Ac): 24.00 g arginine HCl plus 116.34 g ammonium acetate in 2 liters water/24 h. Infusion solutions contained 0, 1, 1 and 2% crude protein equivalent, respectively, above the level of crude protein provided by the diet. NH4Ac and Arg + NH4Ac increased (P&lt;.05) apparent digestibility of N over that observed with treatment C. Arg tended to increase N retention over that observed with C, while both NH4Ac and Arg + NH4Ac resulted in lower (P&lt;.05) N retention than did C and Arg. Mean liver arginase activities (µmol.mg protein-1.h-1) were 166.9, 137.5, 226.3 and 194.5 for heifers infused with C, Arg, NH4Ac and Arg + NH4Ac, respectively. NH4Ac and Arg + NH4Ac resulted in higher (P&lt;.05) arginase activity than did C or Arg. Arg infusion increased plasma urea N (PUN) over that observed with C, while PUN was higher (P&lt;.05) with NH4Ac or Arg + NH4Ac than with C or Arg. NH4Ac infusion increased (P&lt;.05) plasma ammonia-N (PAN) over that observed with Arg or Arg + NH4AC, while PAN levels were the same with C, Arg and Arg + NH4Ac Both Arg and NH4Ac infusion resulted in higher (P&lt;.05) rumen ammonia levels than C, while heifers given Arg + NH4 Ac had rumen ammonia levels similar to those of controls. Mean daily urea excretion was 13.16, 16.02, 28.92 and 32.44 g/24 h for heifers infused with C, Arg, NH4Ac and Arg + NH4Ac, respectively. The major difference in excretion of urea was attributable to NH4Ac and not Arg. Daily urea excretion decreased between 1530 and 2330 h and increased between 2330 and 0730 h. Arginine infusion appeared to have a protective effect against ammonia infusion because PUN increased and PAN decreased in heifers infused with arginine. The reduction (P&lt;.05) in plasma amino acids thought to be limiting for protein synthesis in ruminants in conjunction with increased (P&lt;.05) N retention and the trend toward decreased arginase activity observed in heifers infused with Arg suggests that the effects of arginine on ammonia metabolism are not wholly mediated by liver urea synthesis.'),\n",

       "  'Fescue toxicosis in livestock is due to ingestion of endophyte (Acremonium coenophia-lum) -infected tall fescue. Understanding mechanisms responsible for decreased calving and growth rates, delayed onset of puberty, and impaired function of corpora lutea in heifers at puberty consuming endophyte-infected fescue is an emerging field in reproductive toxicology. The condition decreases overall productivity through a reduction in reproductive efficiency, reduced weight gains, and lowered milk production. Reproduction in cattle may be further compromised by winter coat retention, increased susceptibility to high environmental temperatures, and light intolerance. Endocrine effects in steers associated with infected tall fescue include reduced prolactin and melatonin secretions and altered neurotransmitter metabolism in the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and pineal glands. Ewes have decreased prolactin and lengthened intervals from introduction of the ram until conception. The endophyte induces prolonged gestation, thickened placentas, large, weak foals, dystocia, and agalactia in pregnant mares. Ergot peptide alkaloids, produced by the endophyte, are suggested as the primary cause of fescue toxicosis. These compounds reduce prolactin, increase body temperatures, and have powerful vasoconstrictive effects. Neurohormonal imbalances of prolactin and melatonin, with restricted blood flow to internal organs, may be the principal causes of aberrant reproduction, growth, and maturation in livestock consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue.'),\n",

L-threonine was added to a fortified corn-gelatin diet and fed at a rate to provide five threonine levels of 3.59, 4.95, 6.31, 7.67 and 9.03 g/d. Twenty-five crossbred gilts were randomly assigned to these five dietary treatments. Increasing threonine resulted in a difference (P&lt;.01) in nitrogen (N) retention, with maximum retention at 4.95 g/d threonine intake. Blood samples were drawn before and after feeding. Although plasma urea N did not change significantly, the lowest level occurred at an intake of 4.95 g/d threonine. As threonine intake increased, plasma threonine increased quadratically (P&lt;.05). This increase was accompanied by a quadratic (P&lt;.005) decrease in plasma lysine. Sow weight gains increased quadratically (P&lt;.01) with increasing threonine levels. Litter weight, number of pigs born, baby pig gains, daily milk yield and milk protein were not influenced by threonine levels. The lysine-α-ketoglutarate reductase activity of the sow liver samples increased linearly (P&lt;.05) as dietary threonine levels increased. Based upon metabolic criteria 4.95 g/d L-threonine met the requirement for animals in this experiment. If 75% of threonine in a corn-soybean meal diet is available, the threonine requirement for reproduction would be no higher than 5.4 g/d or .30% dietary threonine when daily feed intake is 1.82 kg.')]"

       "\"For a single person to define or describe new goals in any academic area would indeed be presumptious, perhaps hazardous. The resources and wisdom of several persons in formal committee organization, though at times slow and cumbersome, is the time-honored method of approaching such tasks. The hope is that this procedure will provide order and stability during transitions when change is in order. We would all agree that sound educational principles and the best intellectual development of our undergraduate students require that changes in courses or curriculum represent an evolutionary response to clearly defined needs, rather than whimsical reaction to the current fad or fancy. The emergence of new goals should be the result of responding appropriately in our educative function to changes in the total agricultural enterprise. Therefore, I do not propose to outline a model introductory course in animal science, nor do I expect to present a list of all-encompassing new and re-emphasized goals for such courses. I do choose to discuss some points of importance to consider when we evaluate our introductory courses for content and their role in college and departmental curriculums.Introductory courses in animal science are not currently static. Geyer (1965) reported that many departments had consolidated introductory courses in dairy, meat animal, and poultry sciences in the late 1950's and early 1960's or were in the process of consolidating these courses. The results of his survey also showed that “… in general, the primary emphasis in the course has changed from management, breeds\""

In vitro glucose synthesis from serine by liver slices was increased (P&lt;.05) in urea-fed sheep after 60 days, but not after 48 days on experiment compared to the other dietary treatments. Liver but not muscle serine concentrations were increased in urea-fed sheep after 60 days on experiment compared to those receiving supplemental protein. The enzyme data obtained in this study do not explain the increased liver serine concentrations in urea-fed sheep.'"

       "  'Mastitis, an inflammatory reaction of the mammary gland that is usually caused by a microbial infection, is recognized as the most costly disease in dairy cattle. Decreased milk production accounts for approximately 70% of the total cost of mastitis. Mammary tissue damage reduces the number and activity of epithelial cells and consequently contributes to decreased milk production. Mammary tissue damage has been shown to be induced by either apoptosis or necrosis. These 2 distinct types of cell death can be distinguished by morphological, biochemical, and molecular changes in dying cells. Both bacterial factors and host immune reactions contribute to epithelial tissue damage. During infection of the mammary glands, the tissue damage can initially be caused by bacteria and their products. Certain bacteria produce toxins that destroy cell membranes and damage milk-producing tissue, whereas other bacteria are able to invade and multiply within the bovine mammary epithelial cells before causing cell death. In addition, mastitis is characterized by an influx of somatic cells, primarily polymorphonuclear neutrophils, into the mammary gland. With more immune cells migrating into the mammary gland and the breakdown of the blood-milk barrier, damage to the mammary epithelium worsens. It is well known that breakdown of the extracellular matrix can lead to death of the epithelial cells. Meanwhile, polymorphonuclear neutrophils can harm the mammary tissue by releasing reactive oxygen intermediates and proteolytic enzymes. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the use of antioxidants and other protective compounds in mastitis control programs is worth investigating, because they may aid in alleviating damage to secretory cells and thus reduce subsequent milk loss.'),\n",

       "  'A persistent lactation is dependent on maintaining the number and activity of milk secreting cells with advancing lactation. When dairy cows are milked twice daily, the increase in milk yield from parturition to peak lactation is due to increased secretory activity per cell rather than to accretion of additional epithelial cells. After peak lactation, declining milk yield is due to loss of mammary epithelial cells by apoptosis. During lactation, only 0.3% of mammary cells proliferate in a 24-h period. Yet this proliferative rate is sufficient to replace most mammary epithelial cells by the end of lactation. Management practices can influence lactation persistency. Administration of bovine somatotropin may enhance persistency by increasing cell proliferation and turnover, or by reducing the rate of apoptosis. Increased photoperiod may also increase persistency of lactation by mechanisms that are as yet undefined. Increased milking frequency during the first weeks of lactation increases milk yield, even after return to less frequent milking, with increases of approximately 8% over the entire lactation. A mammary cell proliferation response to frequent milking during early lactation appears to be involved. Conversely, advanced pregnancy, infrequent milking, and mastitis increase death of epithelial cells by apoptosis. Regulation of mammary cell renewal provides a key to increasing persistency. Investigations to characterize epithelial cells that serve as the proliferative population in the bovine mammary gland have been initiated. Epithelial cells that stain lightly in histological sections are evident through all phases of mammary development and secretion and account for nearly all proliferation in the prepubertal gland. Characterization of these cells may provide a means to regulate mammary cell proliferation and thus to enhance persistency, reduce the effects of mastitis, and decrease the necessity for a dry period.'),\n",

Certain bioactive phytochemicals extracted from plants, such as citral and linalool, have demonstrated antimicrobial activity and may serve as acceptable alternatives for conventional mastitis treatments. It is unknown how these phytochemicals may interact with bovine polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), the predominant cell type recruited during mastitis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of citral and linalool on cytotoxicity and the oxidative response of bovine blood PMN in vitro. Blood was sampled from four healthy, primiparous Holstein dairy cows in mid lactation (DIM &gt; 90). Polymorphonuclear cells were isolated and incubated for 2 h with various concentrations of citral (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 10 μL/mL) and linalool (0, 0.1, 1.2, 2.4, and 10 μL/mL). Cytotoxicity was measured by nonradioactive, colorimetric assay to quantify lactate dehydrogenase production. Oxidative burst response for the PMN was measured by relative chemiluminescence of reactive oxidative species production after exposure to 1.6 μg/mL phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate in addition to citral or linalool during incubation. Data were analyzed by ANOVA using the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.2. Each phytochemical was separately analyzed. Differences among treatments were determined using the PDIFF statements and significance was declared at P ≤ 0.05. Citral concentrations of 0.8 and 10 μL/mL increased PMNL cytotoxicity to 33.0 and 68.3%, respectively (P &lt; 0.01), relative to the control. Oxidative burst response increased at 0.01 and 0.02 μL/mL concentrations of citral, whereas 0.4 and 0.8 μL/mL concentrations decreased oxidative burst (P &lt; 0.01). Linalool concentrations equal to or less than 2.4 μL/mL did not alter PMN cytotoxicity relative to the control and 10 μL/mL increased cytotoxicity to 81.2% (P &lt; 0.01). Oxidative response of PMN increased for 1.2, 2.4, and 10 μL/mL concentrations of linalool (P = 0.02). In summary, citral and linalool do affect in vitro bovine blood PMN cytotoxicity and oxidative burst response. Concentrations less than 0.4 μL/mL of citral and 2.4 μL/mL of linalool were nontoxic to bovine blood PMN and concentrations between 0.1 to 0.2 μL/mL citral and 1.2 to 10 μL/mL linalool increased oxidative burst response. The use of citral and linalool as an alternative therapy for mastitis is promising as they may not interfere with the immune response during mastitis.'),\n",

       "  \"Because of the decreasing use of antimicrobial drugs in animal food production, new treatments of infectious diseases such as mastitis are needed. This includes strategies to optimize the function of the animal's immune system. The present review discusses the components of the mammary immune response and the involvement of the blood–milk barrier during infections with different bacteria, strategies to manipulate the blood–milk barrier, and the potential to increase the efficiency of the animal's immune response. The mammary immune response is widely based on the cellular components of the innate immune system, which can be detected as an increase of the somatic cell count (SCC). During infection with Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, characterized by severe clinical symptoms, there is a considerable transfer of soluble blood components including immunoglobulins from blood into milk. This is not typically observed during intramammary infection with Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, which is typically observed as a chronic subclinical infection. We have simulated these different types of mastitis by administering cell wall components of these bacteria (i.e., lipopolysaccharide [LPS] from E. coli and lipoteichoic acid [LTA] from S. aureus). Dosages of these 2 components intramammarily administered were adjusted to induce a comparable increase in SCC. Treatment with LPS caused a comprehensive transfer of blood components including immunoglobulins into milk, whereas in the LTA-induced mastitis, only a small increase of blood components in milk occurred. The blood–milk barrier can be manipulated. Glucocorticoids such as prednisolone reduced the transfer of blood components from blood into milk while reducing the general inflammatory reaction. It is possible that this treatment also inhibits the transfer of immunoglobulins into milk, likely reducing the efficiency of the immune response. In contrast, an opening of the blood–milk barrier could be achieved by an extremely high dosage of oxytocin (e.g., 100 IU). We assume that the myoepithelial hypercontraction increases the epithelial permeability that allows an increased flux of blood components including immunoglobulins into milk. The potential for manipulating the blood–milk barrier permeability as a treatment for mastitis is possible if specific antibodies against pathogens can be efficiently transported to the infected mammary gland.\"),\n",

       "[{'abstract': 'AbstractFibres from a variety of sources are a common constituent of pig feeds. They provide a means to utilise locally-produced plant materials which are often a by-product of the food or drink industry. The value of a high fibre diet in terms of producing satiety has long been recognised. However the addition of fibre can reduce feed intake, which is clearly detrimental during stages of the production cycle when nutrient needs are high, for example in growing piglets and during lactation. More recently, fibre has been found to promote novel benefits to pig production systems, particularly given the reduction in antimicrobial use world-wide, concern for the welfare of animals fed a restricted diet and the need to ensure that such systems are more environmentally friendly. For example, inclusion of dietary fibre can alter the gut microbiota in ways that could reduce the need for antibiotics, while controlled addition of certain fibre types may reduce nitrogen losses into the environment and so reduce the environmental cost of pig production. Of particular potential value is the opportunity to use crude fibre concentrates as ‘functional’ feed additives to improve young pig growth and welfare. Perhaps the greatest opportunity for the use of high fibre diets is to improve the reproductive efficiency of pigs. Increased dietary fibre before mating improves oocyte maturation, prenatal survival and litter size; providing a consumer-acceptable means of increasing the amount of saleable meat produced per sow. The mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects remain to be elucidated. However, changes in plasma and follicular fluid concentrations of key hormones and metabolites, as well as effects of the hypothalamic satiety centre on gonadotrophin secretion and epigenetic effects are strong candidates.',\n",

However, limited information is available regarding the composition and function of the gut microbiome of piglets in early-life. Therefore, we performed 16S rRNA gene and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing of DNA from fecal samples from healthy piglets during weaning to measure microbiome shifts, and to identify the potential contribution of the early-life microbiota in shaping piglet health with a focus on microbial stress responses, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.ResultsThe analysis of 16S rRNA genes and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing revealed significant compositional and functional differences between the fecal microbiome in nursing and weaned piglets. The fecal microbiome of the nursing piglets showed higher relative abundance of bacteria in the genus Bacteroides with abundant gene families related to the utilization of lactose and galactose. Prevotella and Lactobacillus were enriched in weaned piglets with an enrichment for the gene families associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. In addition, an analysis of the functional capacity of the fecal microbiome showed higher abundances of genes associated with heat shock and oxidative stress in the metagenome of weaned piglets compared to nursing piglets.ConclusionsOverall, our data show that microbial shifts and changes in functional capacities of the piglet fecal microbiome resulted in potential reductions in the effects of stress, including dietary changes that occur during weaning. These results provide us with new insights into the piglet gut microbiome that contributes to the growth of the animal.',\n",

As intramuscular adipogenesis is active during the neonatal stage, we hypothesized that vitamin A administration during the neonatal stage would enhance intramuscular adipogenesis and marbling.MethodsAngus steer calves (n\\u2009=\\u200930), in a completely randomized design, were randomly allotted to three treatment groups at birth, receiving 0, 150,000, or 300,000\\xa0IU of vitamin A at both birth and one month of age. A biopsy of the biceps femoris muscle was collected at two months of age. After weaning at 210 d of age, steers were fed a backgrounding diet in a feedlot until 308 d of age, when they were transitioned to a high concentrate finishing diet and implanted with trenbolone/estradiol/tylosin mixture. Steers were harvested at an average of 438 d of age. All diets were formulated to meet nutrient requirements.ResultsWeaning weight and weight during the backgrounding phase were linearly increased (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05) by vitamin A level, though no difference in body weight was observed at harvest. Intramuscular fat of steers at 308 d of age, measured by ultrasound, quadratically increased (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05) with vitamin A level from 4.0±0.26 % to 4.9±0.26\\xa0%. Similarly, carcass marbling score in the ribeye quadratically increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionAdministration of vitamin A at birth increased weaning weight and enhanced marbling fat development. Thus, vitamin A administration provides a practical method for increasing marbling and early growth of beef cattle.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractRecent years have witnessed the great advantages of reducing dietary crude protein (CP) with free amino acids (AA) supplementation for sustainable swine industry, including saving protein ingredients, reducing nitrogen excretion, feed costs and the risk of gut disorders without impairing growth performance compared to traditional diets. However, a tendency toward increased fatness is a matter of concern when pigs are fed low-protein (LP) diets. In response, the use of the net energy system and balanced AA for formulation of LP diets has been proposed as a solution. Moreover, the extent to which dietary CP can be reduced is complicated. Meanwhile, the requirements for the first five limiting AA (lysine, threonine, sulfur-containing AA, tryptophan, and valine) that growing-finishing pigs fed LP diets were higher than pigs fed traditional diets, because the need for nitrogen for endogenous synthesis of non-essential AA to support protein synthesis may be increased when dietary CP is lowered. Overall, to address these concerns and give a better understanding of this nutritional strategy, this paper reviews recent advances in the study of LP diets for swine and provides some insights into future research directions.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundImmune stress induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) influences the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. Presence of LPS interacting Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in the hypothalamus may enable the direct action of LPS on the GnRH/LH secretion. So, the aim of the study was to investigate the influence of intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of TLR4 antagonist on GnRH/LH secretion in anestrous ewes during LPS-induced central inflammation. Animals were divided into three groups icv-treated with: Ringer-Locke solution, LPS and TLR4 antagonist followed by LPS.ResultsIt was demonstrated that TLR4 antagonist reduced LPS-dependent suppression of GnRH gene expression in the preoptic area and in the medial basal hypothalamus, and suppression of receptor for GnRH gene expression in the anterior pituitary gland. It was also shown that TLR4 antagonist reduced suppression of LH release caused by icv injection of LPS. Central administration of LPS stimulated TLR4 gene expression in the medial basal hypothalamus.ConclusionsIt was indicated that blockade of TLR4 prevents the inhibitory effect of centrally acting LPS on the GnRH/LH secretion. This suggests that some negative effects of bacterial infection on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activity at the hypothalamic level may be caused by central action of LPS acting through TLR4.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe present study has evaluated the effects of different inclusion levels of a partially defatted black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.; HI) larva meal on the growth performance, blood parameters and gut morphology of broiler chickens. A total of 256\\xa0male broiler chickens (Ross 308) were reared from d 1 to d 35 and assigned to 4 dietary treatments (8 replicates/treatment and 8 birds/replicate). HI larva meal was included at increasing levels (0, 5%, 10% and 15%; HI0, HI5, HI10 and HI15, respectively) in isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets formulated for 3 feeding phases: starter (1–10 d), growing (10–24 d) and finisher (24–35 d). Two birds per pen were slaughtered at d 35 and morphometric investigations and histopathological alterations were performed.ResultsThe live weight (LW) showed linear and quadratic responses to increasing HI larva meal (maximum for HI10 group). Average daily gain (ADG) showed a linear and quadratic responses to HI meal (maximum for HI10 group) during starter and growing periods. A linear decrease was observed for ADG during the finisher period. The daily feed intake (DFI) showed a linear and quadratic effect during the starter period (maximum for HI10 group). Linear and quadratic responses were observed for the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in the growing period and for the whole period of the experiment. The FCR showed a linear response in the finisher period (maximum for HI15). No significant effects were observed for the blood and serum parameters, except for the phosphorus concentration, which showed linear and quadratic responses as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, the latter of which showed a linear response. The HI15 birds showed a lower villus height, a higher crypt depth and a lower villus height-to-crypt depth ratio than the other groups.ConclusionsIncreasing levels of dietary HI meal inclusion in male broiler chickens may improve the LW and DFI during the starter period, but may also negatively affect the FCR and gut morphology, thus suggesting that low levels may be more suitable. However, no significant effects on the haematochemical parameters or histological findings were observed in relation to HI meal utilization.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundBlack bone sheep was first discovered in Yunnan province of China in 1970, with unique black pigmentation on the body and internal organs. Endothelin 3 (EDN3) has been known as a key gene causing hyperpigmentation in black bone chicken, the Silky fowl.MethodsIn this study, EDN3 was employed as a candidate gene for regulating black color pigmentation. First, EDN3 was cloned from sheep to obtain the full-length cDNA by using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Genomic EDN3 was screened and a total of thirty predicted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped for allele and genotype frequency analysis in a case-control study involving two black bone sheep populations. Genomic copy number analysis of EDN3 in sheep was conducted to measure the variation in copy number. EDN3 expression levels were observed among the groups in adult liver, lymph node, and kidney tissues, as well as embryo kidney samples. Also, among the tissues of black bone and non-black bone sheep.ResultsThe size of the full-length cDNA was 1,578\\xa0bp, which included 426\\xa0bp of 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), an open reading frame (ORF) of 639\\xa0bp encoding a protein of 212 amino acids, and a 3′-UTR of 513\\xa0bp. Genotype and allele frequencies of all the discovered SNPs were found insignificantly different in black bone and non-black bone sheep (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Genomic copy number analysis of EDN3 in sheep revealed no significant difference between the two sheep groups. No significant variations were found in the adult liver and kidney embryo samples. However, the expression in lymph node and kidney tissue was significantly higher in black bone sheep than that in non-black bone sheep (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Significant variations in the EDN3 expression levels were observed among the tissues of non-black bone sheep.ConclusionsThe findings of the present study indicate that unlike in Silky chickens, EDN3 is not responsible for hyperpigmentation but may play a key functional role in immune and excretory systems of black bone sheep.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe aim of the present study was to evaluate CCL8 and CXCL10 expression and its regulatory mechanism in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) at the time of maternal recognition in cows. Blood samples were collected on 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 d after artificial insemination (AI). Based on the day of return of estrus, cows were divided into three groups, pregnant (n\\xa0=\\u20095), early embryonic mortality (EEM; n\\xa0=\\u20095) and late embryonic mortality (LEM; n\\xa0=\\u20095). The gene expression levels in PBLs were assessed with quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR.ResultsThe expression of CCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA in PBLs gradually increased from 14 to 18 d of pregnant cows and significant differences were observed on 18 d (P\\xa0<\\u20090.05), whereas no significant changes were observed both in EEM and LEM cows. Interferon-stimulated protein 15\\xa0kDa (ISG15), myxovirus-resistance gene (MX) 1 and MX2 mRNA expression in PBLs increased from 14 to 18 d which was significant on 18 d of pregnant cows as well as in LEM cows (P\\xa0<\\u20090.05), but no changes were observed in EEM cows. To determine whether the expression of CCL8 and CXCL10 in PBLs was regulated by pregnancy-related substances or not, expression level was assessed after exposure to interferon-τ (IFNT) and CCL16. Monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes were obtained using density-gradient centrifugation and flow cytometry. The addition of IFNT (100\\xa0ng/mL) and CCL16 (100\\xa0ng/mL) to cultured PBLs increased the expression of CCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA (P\\xa0<\\u20090.05). The expression of ISG15, MX1 and MX2 mRNA in PBLs was also stimulated by IFNT and CCL16 (P\\xa0<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe expression of CCL8 and CXCL10 genes increased in PBLs during early pregnancy. Since IFNT stimulated CCL8 and CXCL10 expression in cultured PBLs, the increase of CCL8 and CXCL10 might be pregnancy-dependent events. The expression of both CCL8 and CXCL10 in PBLs was stimulated by CCL16 as well as IFNT, suggesting a chemokine interaction that at least includes CCL8, CXCL10 and CCL16, and may play a role in regulating maternal recognition in cows.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe goat (Caprahircus) is one of the most important livestock animals. Goat milk fat is an important component in the nutritional quality of goat milk. Growing evidence points to the critical roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lipid metabolism.ResultsUsing a highly sensitive method of S-poly(T) plus for miRNAs detection, we analyze the expression patterns of 715 miRNAs in goat mammary gland tissues at different stages of lactation. We observed that miR-25 expression had an inverse relationship with milk production. Overexpression of miR-25 significantly repressed triacylglycerol synthesis and lipid droplet accumulation. To explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-25 in milk lipid metabolism, we analyzed its putative target genes with bioinformatics analysis followed by 3′-UTR assays. Peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 beta (PGC-1beta), a key regulator of lipogenics was identified as a direct target of miR-25 with three specific sites within its 3′-UTR. In addition, miR-25 mimics in goat mammary epithelial cells reduced the expressions of genes involved in lipid metabolism.ConclusionsTaken together, our results show miR-25 is potentially involved in lipid metabolism and we reveal the function of the miR-25/PGC-1beta regulatory axis during lactation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundPathogen or diet-induced immune activation can partition energy and nutrients away from growth, but clear relationships between immune responses and the direction and magnitude of energy partitioning responses have yet to be elucidated. The objectives were to determine how β-mannanase supplementation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immune stimulation affect maintenance energy requirements (MEm) and to characterize immune parameters, digestibility, growth performance, and energy balance.MethodsIn a randomized complete block design, 30 young weaned pigs were assigned to either the control treatment (CON; basal corn, soybean meal and soybean hulls diet), the enzyme treatment (ENZ; basal diet +\\u20090.056% β-mannanase), or the immune system stimulation treatment (ISS; basal diet +\\u20090.056% β-mannanase, challenged with repeated increasing doses of Escherichia coli LPS). The experiment consisted of a 10-d adaptation period, 5-d digestibility and nitrogen balance measurement, 22\\xa0h of heat production (HP) measurements, and 12\\xa0h of fasting HP measurements in indirect calorimetry chambers. The immune challenge consisted of 4 injections of either LPS (ISS) or sterile saline (CON and ENZ), one every 48\\xa0h beginning on d 10. Blood was collected pre- and post-challenge for complete blood counts with differential, haptoglobin and mannan binding lectin, 12 cytokines, and glucose and insulin concentrations.ResultsBeta-mannanase supplementation did not affect immune status, nutrient digestibility, growth performance, energy balance, or MEm. The ISS treatment induced fever, elevated proinflammatory cytokines and decreased leukocyte concentrations (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The ISS treatment did not impact nitrogen balance or nutrient digestibility (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10), but increased total HP (21%) and MEm (23%), resulting in decreased lipid deposition (−30%) and average daily gain (−18%) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThis experiment provides novel data on β-mannanase supplementation effects on immune parameters and energy balance in pigs and is the first to directly relate decreased ADG to increased MEm independent of changes in feed intake in immune challenged pigs. Immune stimulation increased energy partitioning to the immune system by 23% which limited lipid deposition and weight gain. Understanding energy and nutrient partitioning in immune-stressed pigs may provide insight into more effective feeding and management strategies.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe feed conversion ratio (FCR) and residual feed intake (RFI) are common indexes in measuring feed efficiency for livestock. RFI is a feed intake adjusted for requirements for maintenance and production so these two traits are related. Similarly, FCR is related to feed intake and weight gain because it is their ratio. Cholecystokinin type A receptor (CCKAR) plays an important role in animal digestive process. We examined the interplay of these three parameters in a local Chinese chicken population.ResultsThe feed intake (FI) and body weights (BW) of 1,841 individuals were monitored on a daily basis from 56 to 105 d of age. There was a strong correlation between RFI and average daily feed intake (ADFI) and a negative correlation between the FCR and daily gain (rg\\u2009=\\u2009−\\u20090.710). Furthermore, we identified 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CCKAR and 4 of these resulted in amino acid mutations. The C334A mutation was specifically associated with FI and the expected feed intake (EFI) (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01) and significantly associated with the average daily gain (ADG) (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05). G1290A was significantly associated with FI and EFI (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionFCR is apply to weight selecting, and RFI is more appropriate if the breeding focus is feed intake. And C334A and G1290A of the CCKAR gene can be deemed as candidate markers for feed intake and weight gain.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe homeobox containing transcription factor Nanog plays crucial roles in embryonic development/proliferation and/or maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) via interacting with transcription factors such as Oct4 and Sox2 in mammals. However, knowledge of its exact mechanistic pathways remains unexploited. Very little is known about teleost Nanog. Information on the Nanog gene of farmed rohu carp (Labeo rohita) is lacking. We cloned and characterized the Nanog gene of rohu carp to understand the expression pattern in early developmental stages and also deduced the genomic organization including promoter elements.ResultsRohu Nanog (LrNanog) cDNA comprised an open reading frame of 1,161 nucleotides bearing a structural homeodomain; whereas, the genomic structure contained four exons and three introns suggesting that it is homologous to mammalian counterparts. Phylogenetically, it was closely related to freshwater counterparts. Protein sequence (386 AA of 42.65\\xa0kDa) comparison revealed its low similarity with other vertebrate counterparts except that of the conserved homeodomain. Tissue distribution analysis revealed the existence of LrNanog transcripts only in adult gonads. The heightened abundances in the ovary and proliferating spermatogonia suggested its participations in maternal inheritance and male germ cell development. The potentiating abundances from fertilized egg onwards peaking at blastula stage vis- à-vis decreasing levels from gastrula stage onwards demonstrated its role in embryonic stem cell development. We also provided evidence of its presence in\\xa0SSCs by western blotting analysis. Further, the promoter region was characterized, predicting a basal core promoter and other consensus elements.ConclusionThe molecular characterization of LrNanog and its documented expression profiling at transcript and protein levels are indicative of its functional linkage with embryonic/spermatogonial stem cell maintenance. This is the first report of LrNanog genomic organization including its promoter sequence information with predicted regulatory elements of a large-bodied carp species. This will be useful for elucidating its mechanism expression in future. Nanog could be used as a potential biomarker for proliferating carp SSCs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe establishment of pregnancy is a complex process that requires a well-coordinated interaction between the implanting conceptus and the maternal uterus. In pigs, the conceptus undergoes dramatic morphological and functional changes at the time of implantation and introduces various factors, including estrogens and cytokines, interleukin-1β2 (IL1B2), interferon-γ (IFNG), and IFN-δ (IFND), into the uterine lumen. In response to ovarian steroid hormones and conceptus-derived factors, the uterine endometrium becomes receptive to the implanting conceptus by changing its expression of cell adhesion molecules, secretory activity, and immune response. Conceptus-derived estrogens act as a signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy by changing the direction of prostaglandin (PG) F2α from the uterine vasculature to the uterine lumen. Estrogens also induce the expression of many endometrial genes, including genes related to growth factors, the synthesis and transport of PGs, and immunity. IL1B2, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is produced by the elongating conceptus. The direct effect of IL1B2 on endometrial function is not fully understood. IL1B activates the expression of endometrial genes, including the genes involved in IL1B signaling and PG synthesis and transport. In addition, estrogen or IL1B stimulates endometrial expression of IFN signaling molecules, suggesting that estrogen and IL1B act cooperatively in priming the endometrial function of conceptus-produced IFNG and IFND that, in turn, modulate endometrial immune response during early pregnancy. This review addresses information about maternal-conceptus interactions with respect to endometrial gene expression in response to conceptus-derived factors, focusing on the roles of estrogen and IL1B during early pregnancy in pigs.',\n",

IFN-γ reportedly affects the phagocytic ability of monocytes and macrophages as well as regulates pituitary function in humans and mice. The present study analyzed the impact of IFN-γ on monocyte and macrophage phagocytosis, production performance, and pituitary function in vivo and in vitro (in dwarf chickens). IFN-γ was injected into dwarf chickens through a vein, and then, the laying rate, average egg weight, and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and IFN-γ were measured in treatment and control groups. For the in vitro experiment, the pituitary tissues were supplemented with IFN-γ, and the mRNA expression levels of follicle-stimulating hormone beta subunit (FSH-β), interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1), and interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in the pituitary were assessed.ResultsMonocyte and macrophage phagocytosis product (PP) was decreased by IFN-γ treatment in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In the in vivo experiment, the level of IFN-γ in the treatment group was higher than that in the control group at 7 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), 14 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), and 21 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) post-injection. Compared with the control group, monocyte and macrophage PP was lower in the treatment group after injection (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The laying rate was higher in the treatment group than in the control group at 2 and 3\\xa0wk post-injection (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). There was a significant difference between the treatment and control groups in the levels of FSH at 1, 3, 7, and 14 d post-injection (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). In the in vitro experiment, increased mRNA expression levels of FSH-β, IFNGR1, and IFNGR2 were observed in the treatment group after stimulation with 100\\xa0U/mL IFN-γ for 24\\xa0h compared to those in the control group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsIFN-γ inhibited the phagocytosis of monocytes and macrophages; up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of the FSH-β, IFNGR1, and IFNGR2; enhanced the secretion of FSH; and improved the laying rate.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIn the past two decades, a considerable amount of research has focused on the determination of the digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) contents of feed ingredients fed to swine. Compared with the DE and ME systems, the net energy (NE) system is assumed to be the most accurate estimate of the energy actually available to the animal. However, published data pertaining to the measured NE content of ingredients fed to growing pigs are limited. Therefore, the Feed Data Group at the Ministry of Agricultural Feed Industry Centre (MAFIC) located at China Agricultural University has evaluated the NE content of many ingredients using indirect calorimetry. The present review summarizes the NE research works conducted at MAFIC and compares these results with those from other research groups on methodological aspect. These research projects mainly focus on estimating the energy requirements for maintenance and its impact on the determination, prediction, and validation of the NE content of several ingredients fed to swine. The estimation of maintenance energy is affected by methodology, growth stage, and previous feeding level. The fasting heat production method and the curvilinear regression method were used in MAFIC to estimate the NE requirement for maintenance. The NE contents of different feedstuffs were determined using indirect calorimetry through standard experimental procedure in MAFIC. Previously generated NE equations can also be used to predict NE in situations where calorimeters are not available. Although popular, the caloric efficiency is not a generally accepted method to validate the energy content of individual feedstuffs. In the future, more accurate and dynamic NE prediction equations aiming at specific ingredients should be established, and more practical validation approaches need to be developed.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundFasting is a simple metabolic strategy that is used to estimate the maintenance energy requirement where the energy supply for basic physiological functions is provided by the mobilization of body reserves. However, the underlying metabolic components of maintenance energy expenditure are not clear. This study investigated the differences in heat production (HP), respiratory quotient (RQ) and plasma metabolites in pigs in the fed and fasted state, using the techniques of indirect calorimetry and metabolomics.MethodsNine barrows (45.2\\u2009±\\u20091.7\\xa0kg BW) were fed corn-soybean based meal diets and were kept in metabolism crates for a period of 14 d. After 7 d adaptation, pigs were transferred to respiratory chambers to determine HP and RQ based on indirect calorimetry. Pigs were fed the diet at 2,400\\xa0kJ ME/(kg BW0.6·d) during d 8 to 12. The last 2\\xa0d were divided into 24\\xa0h fasting and 48\\xa0h fasting treatment, respectively. Plasma samples of each pig were collected from the anterior vena cava during the last 3 d (1 d while pigs were fed and 2 d during which they were fasted). The metabolites of plasma were determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry using a metabolomics approach.ResultsIndirect calorimetry analysis revealed that HP and RQ were no significant difference between 24\\xa0h fasting and 48\\xa0h fasting, which were lower than those of fed state (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01). The nitrogen concentration of urine tended to decrease with fasting (P\\u2009=\\u20090.054). Metabolomics analysis between the fed and fasted state revealed differences in 15 compounds, most of which were not significantly different between 24\\xa0h fasting and 48\\xa0h fasting. Identified compounds were enriched in metabolic pathways related to linoleic acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis.ConclusionThese results suggest that the decreases in HP and RQ of growing pigs under fasting conditions were associated with the alterations of linoleic acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The integrative analysis also revealed that growing pigs under a 24-h fasting were more appropriate than a 48-h fasting to investigate the metabolic components of maintenance energy expenditure.',\n",

Each treatment contained 10 replicates with 1 gilt per replicate. Gilts were housed in an environmentally controlled room with the partially slatted floor.ResultsDuring the entire experimental period of 28 d, average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of gilts in MO group was significantly reduced compared with those in CO group. The vulva size of gilts was significantly higher in MO group than CO group. In addition, significant increases in the plasma levels of IgA, IgG, IL-8, IL-10 and PRL were determined in MO group compared with that in CO group. ZEA and DON in the diet up-regulated apoptotic caspase-3 in ovaries and uteri, along with down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in ovaries. The supplementation of MBA into diets co-contaminated with ZEA and DON significantly increased ADG, decreased the vulva sizes, reduced the levels of IgG, IL-8 and PRL in plasma, and regulated apoptosis in ovaries and uteri of gilts.ConclusionsThe present results indicated that feeding diet contaminated with ZEA and DON simultaneously (596.86\\xa0μg/kg\\u2009+\\u2009796\\xa0μg/kg) had detrimental effects on growth performance, plasma immune function and reproductive status of gilts. And MBA could reduce the negative impacts of these two toxins, believed as a promising feed additive for mitigating toxicosis of ZEA and DON at low levels in gilts.',\n",

The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in ruminal bacteria, biopolymer hydrolyzing enzyme activities, and overall performance between the most- and the least-efficient dairy cows during the peripartal period. Twenty multiparous Holstein dairy cows with daily ad libitum access to a total mixed ration from d\\u2009−\\u200910 to d 60 relative to the calving date were used. Cows were classified into most-efficient (i.e. with low RFI, n\\u2009=\\u200910) and least-efficient (i.e. with high RFI, n\\u2009=\\u200910) based on a linear regression model involving dry matter intake (DMI), fat-corrected milk (FCM), changes in body weight (BW), and metabolic BW.ResultsThe most-efficient cows had ~\\u20092.6\\xa0kg/d lower DMI at wk 4, 6, 7, and 8 compared with the least-efficient cows. In addition, the most-efficient cows had greater relative abundance of total ruminal bacterial community during the peripartal period. Compared with the least-efficient cows, the most-efficient cows had 4-fold greater relative abundance of Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens at d\\u2009−\\u200910 and d 10 around parturition and tended to have greater abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Megaspheara elsdenii. In contrast, the relative abundance of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and Streptococcus bovis was lower and Succinimonas amylolytica and Prevotella bryantii tended to be lower in the most-efficient cows around calving. During the peripartal period, the most-efficient cows had lower enzymatic activities of cellulase, amylase, and protease compared with the least-efficient cows.ConclusionsThe results suggest that shifts in ruminal bacteria and digestive enzyme activities during the peripartal period could, at least in part, be part of the mechanism associated with better feed efficiency in dairy cows.',\n",

CO2 concentration is a critical factor that can affect meat quality in the commercial use of gas stunning (GS). However, the effect and mechanism of CO2 stunning on meat color and lipid peroxidation during long-term storage remain poorly studied. We aimed to study the effects of GS methods, especially CO2 concentration, on meat color and meat lipid peroxidation in broilers during long-term storage at 4 °C and to explore the potential mechanism of meat color change via lipid peroxidation and the inner lipid peroxide scavenging system.MethodsEighteen broilers were sacrificed after exposure to one of the following gas mixtures for 90\\xa0s: 40% CO2\\u2009+\\u200921% O2\\u2009+ 39%\\u2009N2 (G40%), 79% CO2\\u2009+\\u200921% O2 (G79%), or no stunning (0% CO2, control). Meat color, serum variables, enzyme activities, and the gene expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined.ResultsThe concentrations of serum triiodothyronine (T3, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) and the ratio of serum free triiodothyronine/free thyroxine (FT3/FT4, P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01) were decreased, whereas levels of serum cortisol (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01) were increased in the 40% CO2 group compared with the control group. Additionally, the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) 3 d (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01) and TBARS 6 d (P\\u2009=\\u20090.01) in breast meat and the TBARS 3 d in thigh meat (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01) were increased in the 40% CO2 group compared with the control group. Serum T3 was negatively correlated with TBARS6 d both in the breast and thigh meat (r\\u2009=\\u2009−\\u20090.63, P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01 and r\\u2009=\\u2009−\\u20090.47, P\\u2009=\\u20090.05 respectively).

In the breast muscle, the mRNA levels of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03), GSTT1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.04), and SOD1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) were decreased, and the mRNA levels of JNK1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07), Nrf2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09), and GSTA3 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) were slightly lower in both the G40% and G79% groups compared with the control group. However, among these genes, only the mRNA level of JNK1 was decreased in the G40% group compared with the control group and the G79% group (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) in the thigh muscle.ConclusionsCompared with the control group, meat color quality in the breast meat was decreased, and the expression of genes in the MAPK/Nrf2/ARE (antioxidant responsive element) antioxidant pathway in breast muscle was partly suppressed by GS of both 40% and 79% CO2. However, oxidative stress and meat lipid peroxidation during storage were aggravated by GS with 40% CO2 compared to GS with 79% CO2 and no GS.',\n",

Despite a critical role of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in regulating cellular stress response, the crosstalk between mTORC1 and ER stress signaling and its contribution to the intestinal barrier function is unknown.ResultsIn the present study, we showed that intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) incubated with tunicamycin led to caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death. The induction of cell death was accompanied by activation of unfolded protein response as evidenced by increased protein levels for BiP, p-IRE1α, p-eIF2α, p-JNK, and CHOP. Further study demonstrated that tunicamycin-induced cell death was enhanced by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTORC1. Consistently, tunicamycin decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased permeability of the cells. These effects of tunicamycin\\xa0were exacerbated by mTORC1 inhibitor.ConclusionsTaken together, the data presented here identified a previously unknown crosstalk between an\\xa0unfold protein response and mTORC1 signaling in the intestinal epithelium. This feed-back loop regulation on ER stress signaling by mTORC1 is critical for cell survival and intestinal permeability in epithelial cells.',\n",

The goal of this study was to interrogate biochemical profiles manifested in skeletal muscle originating from slow growing (SG) and faster growing littermates (control), with the aim of identifying differences in metabolic pathway utilization between skeletal muscle of the SG pig relative to its littermates. Samples of longissimus muscle from littermate pairs of pigs were collected at 21\\xa0d of age for metabolomic analysis (Metabolon, Inc., Durham, NC).ResultsBirth weights did not differ between littermate pairs of SG and Control pigs (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Weaning weights differed by 1.51\\u2009±\\u20090.19\\xa0kg (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Random forest (RF) analysis was effective at segregating the metabolome of muscle samples by growth rate, resulting in a predictive accuracy of 81% versus random segregation (50%). Decreases in sugars in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in the longissimus of SG pigs were detected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Decreases were also apparent in glycolytic intermediates (glycerol-3-phosphate and lactate) and key glycolysis-derived intermediates (glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate; P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). SG pigs had increased levels of phospholipids, lysolipids, diacylglycerols, and sphingolipids (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Pathway analysis identified a cluster of molecules associated with muscle and collagen/extracellular matrix breakdown that are increased in the SG pig (glutamate, 3-methylhistidine and hydroxylated proline moieties; P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Nicotinate metabolism was altered in SG pigs, resulting in a 78% decrease in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pool (P\\u2009<\\xa00.05).ConclusionsThese metabolomic data provide the first evidence for biochemical mechanisms that should be investigated to determine if they have a potential role in the slow growth in some normal birth weight piglets that contribute to increased intra-litter variability in weaning weights and provides essential information and potential targets for the development of nutritional intervention strategies.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractNitrogenous emissions from ruminant livestock production are of increasing public concern and, together with methane, contribute to environmental pollution. The main cause of nitrogen-(N)-containing emissions is the inadequate provision of N to ruminants, leading to an excess of ammonia in the rumen, which is subsequently excreted. Depending on the size and molecular structure, various bacterial, protozoal and fungal species are involved in the ruminal breakdown of nitrogenous compounds (NC). Decelerating ruminal NC degradation by controlling the abundance and activity of proteolytic and deaminating microorganisms, but without reducing cellulolytic processes, is a promising strategy to decrease N emissions along with increasing N utilization by ruminants. Different dietary options, including among others the treatment of feedstuffs with heat or the application of diverse feed additives, as well as vaccination against rumen microorganisms or their enzymes have been evaluated. Thereby, reduced productions of microbial metabolites, e.g. ammonia, and increased microbial N flows give evidence for an improved N retention. However, linkage between these findings and alterations in the rumen microbiota composition, particularly NC-degrading microbes, remains sparse and contradictory findings confound the exact evaluation of these manipulating strategies, thus emphasizing the need for comprehensive research. The demand for increased sustainability in ruminant livestock production requests to apply attention to microbial N utilization efficiency and this will require a better understanding of underlying metabolic processes as well as composition and interactions of ruminal NC-degrading microorganisms.',\n",

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary resveratrol supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the antioxidant status of sows and piglets and on antioxidant gene expression and pathway in placenta.MethodsForty sows were allotted to 2 dietary treatments 20 d after breeding. Sows were fed a control diet and a control diet with 300\\xa0mg/kg resveratrol. Oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant enzymes were measured in the placenta, milk, and plasma of sows and piglets. Antioxidant gene expression and protein expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Keap1-Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa B-p65 (NFκB-p65) and sirtuin1 (Sirt1) were quantified in the placenta.ResultsDietary resveratrol increased the litter and piglets weaning weights. Antioxidant status in the milk, placenta and plasma of sows and piglets was partially improved by dietary resveratrol. In placenta, Nrf2 protein expression was increased and Keap1 protein expression was decreased by dietary resveratrol. The mRNA expression of antioxidant genes including catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), GPX4, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), and phase 2 detoxification genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM), microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1(MGST1) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was increased by dietary resveratrol. Dietary resveratrol also increased Sirt1 and phosphorylated NFκB-p65 protein expression in the placenta. We failed to observe any influences of dietary resveratrol on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including those of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). However, we observed that the mRNA expression of IL-8 in placenta was reduced by maternal resveratrol. In addition, dietary resveratrol showed interactive effects with day of lactation on activities of SOD and CAT and levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in milk.ConclusionsDietary resveratrol supplementation during pregnancy and lactation improves the antioxidant status of sows and piglets, which is beneficial to the reproductive performance of sows. Dietary resveratrol regulates placental antioxidant gene expression by the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and Sirt1 in placenta.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe objectives of this study were to characterize changes in the relative mRNA expression of candidate genes and proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in the ruminal epithelium (RE) of sheep during high-grain (HG) diet adaptation.ResultsTwenty sheep were assigned to four groups with five animals each. These animals were assigned to different periods of HG diet (containing 40% forage and 60% concentrate mix) feeding. The HG groups received an HG diet for 7 (G7, n\\u2009=\\u20095), 14 (G14, n\\u2009=\\u20095) and 28 d (G28, n\\u2009=\\u20095), respectively. In contrast, the control group (CON, n\\u2009=\\u20095) was fed the forage-based diet for 28\\xa0d. The results showed that HG feeding linearly decreased (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001) the ruminal pH, and increased the concentrations of ruminal total volatile fatty acid (linear, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), butyrate (linear, P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001), valerate (quadratic P\\u2009=\\u20090.029) and the level of IGF-1 (quadratic, P\\u2009=\\u20090.043) in plasma. The length (quadratic, P\\u2009=\\u20090.004), width (cubic, P\\u2009=\\u20090.015) and surface of the ruminal papillae (linear, P\\u2009=\\u20090.003) were all enlarged after 14 d of HG diet feeding. HG feeding cubically increased the number of cell layers forming the stratum corneum (SC, P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001) and the thickness of the SC (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001) and stratum basale (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001). The proportion of basal layer cells in the RE decreased (linear, P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001) in the G0/G1-phase, but it increased linearly (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006) in the S-phase and cubically (P\\u2009=\\u20090.004) in the G2/M-phases. The proportion of apoptosis cells in G7, G14 and G28 was reduced compared to the CON (quadratic, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). HG diet feeding linearly decreased the mRNA expression of Cyclin E1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.021) and CDK-2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and (P\\u2009=\\u20090.027) the protein expression of Cyclin E1. Feeding an HG diet linearly increased the mRNA expression of genes IGFBP-2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.034) and IGFBP 5 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.009), while linearly decreasing (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) the IGFBP 3 expression.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundAcquisition of pluripotency by transcriptional regulatory factors is an initial developmental event that is required for regulation of cell fate and lineage specification during early embryonic development. The evolutionarily conserved core transcriptional factors regulating the pluripotency network in fishes, amphibians, and mammals have been elucidated. There are also species-specific maternally inherited transcriptional factors and their intricate transcriptional networks important in the acquisition of pluripotency. In avian species, however, the core transcriptional network that governs the acquisition of pluripotency during early embryonic development is not well understood.ResultsWe found that chicken NANOG (cNANOG) was expressed in the stages between the pre-ovulatory follicle and oocyte and was continuously detected in Eyal-Giladi and Kochav stage I (EGK.I) to X. However, cPOUV was not expressed during folliculogenesis, but began to be detectable between EGK.V and VI. Unexpectedly, cSOX2 could not be detected during folliculogenesis and intrauterine embryonic development. Instead of cSOX2, cSOX3 was maternally inherited and continuously expressed during chicken intrauterine development. In addition, we found that the pluripotency-related genes such as cENS-1, cKIT, cLIN28A, cMYC, cPRDM14, and cSALL4 began to be dramatically upregulated between EGK.VI and VIII.ConclusionThese results suggest that chickens have a unique pluripotent circuitry since maternally inherited cNANOG and cSOX3 may play an important role in the initial acquisition of pluripotency. Moreover, the acquisition of pluripotency in chicken embryos occurs at around EGK.VI to VIII.',\n",

Plasma amino acids (AA) in sows are important precursors for milk protein synthesis in the mammary gland. In order to study the regulation of AA transported in sow mammary glands and possible underlying mechanisms, we measured the expression of genes coding for milk proteins, AA transporter expressions, and plasma AA concentrations in sows at three different physiological stages (D-17, D1 and D17 of lactation), and then further investigated the regulation of AA transport across the cell membrane by adaptive mechanisms using pig mammary epithelial cells (PMEC) as an in vitro model. PMEC were cultured in DMEM:F12 with 4 amino acid concentrations (0\\u2009×\\u2009AA complex, 1\\u2009×\\u2009AA complex, 5\\u2009×\\u2009AA complex, and 25\\u2009×\\u2009AA complex). Classes of AA complexes evaluated in this study included neutral AAs (L-Ala + L-Ser\\u2009+\\u2009L-Cys), acidic AAs (L-Asp, L-Glu) and neutral + basic AAs (L-Ala + L-Ser\\u2009+\\u2009L-Cys\\u2009+\\u2009L-Lys).ResultsOur results indicated that mRNA expression of genes coding for milk protein (αs1-casein, αs2-casein, β-casein and κ-casein) increased significantly with the advance of physiological stage (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and plasma concentrations of most AAs including threonine, serine, glutamate, alanine, valine, cysteine, methionine, isoleucine and tyrosine were greater at D1 of lactation compared with D-17 and D17 of lactation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, protein and gene expressions of AA transporters including excitatory AA transporter 3 (EAAT3), alanine/serine/cysteine/threonine transporter (ASCT1) and sodium-coupled neutral AA transporter 1 (SNAT2) were greater in lactating sow mammary glands compared with sow mammary glands in late pregnancy (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundSoybean meal is an excellent and cost-effective protein source; however, its usage is limited in the piglet due to the presence of anti-nutritional factors and the antigens glycinin and β-conglycinin. The objective of the current study was to screen and select for bacteria that can be efficiently adopted to ferment soybean meal in order to solve this problem.ResultsBacteria were isolated from fermented soy foods and the grass carp intestine, and strains selected for high protease, cellulase and amylase activities. The isolated bacteria were characterized as Bacillus cereus,\\xa0Bacillus subtilis and Bacilus amyloliquefacien, respectively. Fermentation with food-derived Isolate-2 and fish-derived F-9 increased crude protein content by 5.32% and 8.27%, respectively; improved the amino acid profile by increasing certain essential amino acids, broke down larger soy protein to 35\\xa0kDa and under, eliminated antigenicity against glycinin and β-conglycinin, and removed raffinose and stachyose in the soybean meal following a 24-h fermentation.ConclusionsOur results suggest these two B. amyloliquefaciens bacteria can efficiently solid state ferment soybean meal and ultimately produce a more utilizable food source for growing healthy piglets.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe degree of adipose tissue development at birth may influence neonatal survival and subsequent health outcomes. Despite their lower birth weights, piglets from Meishan sows (a fat breed with excellent maternal ability) have a higher survival rate than piglets from Large White sows (a lean breed). To identify the main pathways involved in subcutaneous adipose tissue maturation during the last month of gestation, we compared the proteome and the expression levels of some genes at d\\xa090 and d\\xa0110 of gestation in purebred and crossbred Large White or Meishan fetuses gestated by sows of either breed.ResultsA total of 52 proteins in fetal subcutaneous adipose tissue were identified as differentially expressed over the course of gestation. Many proteins involved in energy metabolism were more abundant, whereas some proteins participating in cytoskeleton organization were reduced in abundance on d\\xa0110 compared with d\\xa090. Irrespective of age, 24 proteins differed in abundance between fetal genotypes, and an interaction effect between fetal age and genotype was observed for 13 proteins. The abundance levels of proteins known to be responsive to nutrient levels such as aldolase and fatty acid binding proteins, as well as the expression levels of FASN, a key lipogenic enzyme, and MLXIPL, a pivotal transcriptional mediator of glucose-related stimulation of lipogenic genes, were elevated in the adipose tissue of pure and crossbred fetuses from Meishan sows. These data suggested that the adipose tissue of these fetuses had superior metabolic functionality, whatever their paternal genes. Conversely, proteins participating in redox homeostasis and apoptotic cell clearance had a lower abundance in Meishan than in Large White fetuses. Time-course differences in adipose tissue protein abundance were revealed between fetal genotypes for a few secreted proteins participating in responses to organic substances, such as alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, transferrin and albumin.ConclusionsThese results underline the importance of not only fetal age but also maternal intrauterine environment in the regulation of several proteins in subcutaneous adipose tissue. These proteins may be used to estimate the maturity grade of piglet neonates.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundGenome-wide association studies and genomic predictions are thought to be optimized by using whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. However, sequencing thousands of individuals of interest is expensive. Imputation from SNP panels to WGS data is an attractive and less expensive approach to obtain WGS data. The aims of this study were to investigate the accuracy of imputation and to provide insight into the design and execution of genotype imputation.ResultsWe genotyped 450 chickens with a 600\\xa0K SNP array, and sequenced 24 key individuals by whole genome re-sequencing. Accuracy of imputation from putative 60\\xa0K and 600\\xa0K array data to WGS data was 0.620 and 0.812 for Beagle, and 0.810 and 0.914 for FImpute, respectively. By increasing the sequencing cost from 24X to 144X, the imputation accuracy increased from 0.525 to 0.698 for Beagle and from 0.654 to 0.823 for FImpute. With fixed sequence depth (12X), increasing the number of sequenced animals from 1 to 24, improved accuracy from 0.421 to 0.897 for FImpute and from 0.396 to 0.777 for Beagle. Using optimally selected key individuals resulted in a higher imputation accuracy compared with using randomly selected individuals as a reference population for re-sequencing. With fixed reference population size (24), imputation accuracy increased from 0.654 to 0.875 for FImpute and from 0.512 to 0.762 for Beagle as the sequencing depth increased from 1X to 12X. With a given total cost of genotyping, accuracy increased with the size of the reference population for FImpute, but the pattern was not valid for Beagle, which showed the highest accuracy at six fold coverage for the scenarios used in this study.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we comprehensively investigated the impacts of several key factors on genotype imputation. Generally, increasing sequencing cost gave a higher imputation accuracy. But with a fixed sequencing cost, the optimal imputation enhance the performance of WGP and GWAS. An optimal imputation strategy should take size of reference population, imputation algorithms, marker density, and population structure of the target population and methods to select key individuals into consideration comprehensively. This work sheds additional light on how to design and execute genotype imputation for livestock populations.',\n",

After birth, piglets born live were classified as low birth-weight (LBW; <\\u20091\\xa0kg) and normal birth-weight (NBW; ≥1\\xa0kg). During the growing phase, 240 control and 230 underfed pigs (50% males and females) distributed by BW category and sex were studied until the slaughter.ResultsAt birth and weaning, there were significant differences in all morphological measures and weight between NBW and LBW piglets as expected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0005), but few effects of the gestational feed restriction. During the growing phase, NBW pigs continued with higher weight than LBW pigs on all the days of evaluation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), even though control-LBW-females and LBW-males showed a catch-up growth. However, underfed pigs showed slower growth and higher feed conversion ratio than control pigs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) at 215\\xa0days old. Moreover, the average daily weight gain (ADWG) for the overall period was greater for NBW, male and control pigs than for their LBW, female and underfed pigs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001, P<\\u20090.0005 and P<\\u20090.05, respectively) and NBW pigs were slaughtered at a younger age than LBW pigs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001).

GC has profound effects on plasma glucose level and other metabolic conditions. However, the effect of prolonged use of Dex on glucose metabolism in ruminants is still unclear.ResultsTen goats were randomly assigned to two groups: the control goats were injected with saline, and the Dex-treated goats were intramuscularly injected daily for 21 d with 0.2\\xa0mg/kg Dex. The results showed that plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly increased after Dex administration (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, the content of hepatic glycogen was also markedly increased in Dex-treated goats (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), while the content of glycogen in dorsal longissimus was unchanged by Dex (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). The expression of several key genes, involved in blood glucose regulation, was detected by real-time PCR in the small intestine, skeletal muscle and liver. The expression of glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2), sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and sodium-potassium ATPase (Na-K/ATPase) in the small intestine were generally increased by Dex, and GLUT2 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In liver, the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis including glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC), cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC), were significantly down-regulated by Dex. However, the protein expression levels of PCK1 & PCK2 were significantly increased by Dex, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. In dorsal longissimus, the mRNA expression of genes associated with gluconeogenesis and the insulin signaling pathway were generally up-regulated by Dex, but the mRNA expression of two markers of muscle atrophy, namely F-box protein 32 (FBXO32/Atrogin1) and muscle RING-finger protein 1 (MuRF1), was not altered by Dex.ConclusionsTaken together, these results indicate that chronic administration of a low dosage of Dex induces hyperglycemia mainly through gluconeogenesis activation in the goat liver.',\n",

Twelve Holstein cows were used in a replicated 3\\u2009×\\u20093 Latin square design with three dietary treatments: (1) low-NFC diet (NFC\\u2009=\\u200935.6%, L-NFC), (2) high-NFC diet (NFC\\u2009=\\u200940.1%, H-NFC), and (3) alfalfa hay diet (NFC\\u2009=\\u200938.9%, AH).ResultsIntake of DM was lower for cows fed H-NFC compared to L-NFC and AH, while the milk yield was higher in AH than in H-NFC and L-NFC (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The feed efficiency (milk yield/DM intake, 1.15 vs. 1.08, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) were greater for cows fed H-NFC than L-NFC. The contents of milk protein and lactose were not different among the groups (P\\u2009>\\u20090.11), but milk fat content was higher for cows fed H-NFC and L-NFC compared to AH (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration and the concentrations of urea nitrogen in blood and milk were lower for cows fed H-NFC and AH compared to L-NFC (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The concentrations of rumen propionate and total volatile fatty acids were different among groups (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) with higher concentration for cows fed AH compared to H-NFC and L-NFC, and acetate concentration tended to be different among groups (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06).ConclusionsFrom the results obtained in this study, it was inferred that the increased NFC content in a diet containing corn stover can improve the feed efficiency and benefit the nitrogen conversion.',\n",

However, little is known about BA’s effects on piglets with intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR). Therefore, this study investigated the effects of BA supplementation on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, inflammatory response, and microbiota of IUGR piglets.MethodsEighteen litters of newborn piglets were selected at birth, with one normal birth weight (NBW) and two IUGR piglets in each litter (i.e., 18 NBW and 36 IUGR piglets in total). At weaning, the NBW piglet and one of the IUGR piglets were assigned to groups fed a control diet (i.e., the NBW-CON and IUGR-CON groups). The other IUGR piglet was assigned to a group fed the control diet supplemented with 2.0\\xa0g BA per kg of diet (i.e., IUGR-BA group). The piglets were thus distributed across three groups for a four-week period.ResultsIUGR reduced the growth performance of the IUGR-CON piglets compared with the NBW-CON piglets. It was also associated with decreased villus sizes, increased apoptosis rates, reduced goblet cell numbers, and an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the small intestine. Supplementation with BA improved the average daily weight gain and the feed efficiency of the IUGR-BA group compared with the IUGR-CON group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The IUGR-BA group exhibited increases in the ratio of jejunal villus height to crypt depth, in ileal villus height, and in ileal goblet cell density. They also exhibited decreases in the numbers of jejunal and ileal apoptotic cells and ileal proliferative cells (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Supplementation with BA increased interleukin 10 content, but it decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha level in the small intestines of the IUGR-BA piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Furthermore, compared with the IUGR-CON piglets, the IUGR-BA piglets had less Escherichia coli in their jejunal digesta, but more Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in their ileal digesta (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsDietary supplementation with BA improves morphology, decreases inflammatory response, and regulates microbiota in the small intestines of IUGR piglets, which may contribute to improved growth performance during early life.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundColostrum is the first secretion produced by mammary glands during the hours immediately preceding and succeeding parturition. This secretion differs from milk and represents an essential vehicle of passive immunity, prebiotic compounds and growth factors involved in intestinal development. Most of the literature concerning colostrum composition refers mainly to human and cow; and little is known about pig colostrum metabolome and how it varies between pig breeds and different farrowing parity. Thus, the aim of the present research is to provide new information about pig colostrum composition and the associations between metabolites, the sows’ breed and the survival and growth rates of their litters.ResultsColostrum samples were gathered from 58 parturitions of sows belonging to three different breeds chosen for their importance in Italian heavy pig production: 31 Large White, 15 Landrace and 12 Duroc respectively. The defatted and ultrafiltered colostrum samples were analysed using 1H–NMR spectroscopy. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was assessed on the obtained spectra. In addition, using a Stepwise Regression and a Linear Regression analyses the metabolites named after the signals assignment were tested for their associations with piglets’ performances. Twenty-five metabolites were identified, comprehending monosaccharides, disaccharides (such as lactose), organic acids (lactate, citrate, acetate and formate), nitrogenous organic acids (such as creatine) and other compounds, including nucleotides. PCA results evidence a clustering due to breed and season effects. Lactose was the main compound determining the assignment of the samples into different clusters according to the sow breed. Furthermore, some metabolites showed to be associated with piglets’ performance and survival traits: acetate and taurine were positively related to litter weight gain and piglets’ survival rate, respectively, while dimethylamine and cis-aconitate were linked to new-borns’ impaired ability to survive.ConclusionsThe results obtained suggest that colostrum composition is affected by breed, which, together with environmental conditions, may cause changes in colostrum metabolites content with possible consequences on piglets’ performances. Among the identified metabolites, acetate, taurine, dimethylamine and cis-aconitate showed consistent associations with piglets’ survival rate and litter weight gain, implying that these compounds may affect new-borns’ ability to survive.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn rumen fermentation, fumaric acid (FA) could competitively utilize hydrogen with methanogenesis to enhance propionate production and suppress methane emission, but both effects were diet-dependent. This study aimed to explore the effects of FA supplementation on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation in goats fed diets varying in forage and concentrate particle size.MethodsFour rumen-cannulated goats were used in a 4\\u2009×\\u20094 Latin square design with a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement of treatments: low or high ratio of forage particle size: concentrate particle size (Fps:Cps), without or with FA supplementation (24\\xa0g/d). Fps:Cps was higher in the diet with chopped alfalfa hay plus ground corn than in that with ground alfalfa hay plus crushed corn.ResultsBoth increasing dietary Fps:Cps and FA supplementation shifted ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) patterns toward more propionate and less acetate in goats. An interaction between dietary Fps:Cps and FA supplementation was observed for the ratio of acetate to propionate (A:P), which was more predominant when FA was supplemented in the low-Fps:Cps diet. Methane production was reduced by FA, and the reduction was larger in the low-Fps:Cps diet (31.72%) than in the high-Fps:Cps diet (17.91%). Fumaric acid decreased ruminal total VFA concentration and increased ruminal pH. No difference was found in ruminal DM degradation of concentrate or alfalfa hay by dietary Fps:Cps or FA. Goats presented a lower ruminal methanogen abundance with FA supplementation and a higher B. fibrisolvens abundance with high dietary Fps:Cps.ConclusionsAdjusting dietary Fps:Cps is an alternative dietary model for studying diet-dependent effects without changing dietary chemical composition. Fumaric acid supplementation in the low-Fps:Cps diet showed greater responses in methane mitigation and propionate increase.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe tools available for genome engineering have significantly improved over the last 5\\xa0years, allowing scientist to make precise edits to the genome. Along with the development of these new genome editing tools has come advancements in technologies used to deliver them. In mammals genome engineering tools are typically delivered into in vitro fertilized single cell embryos which are subsequently cultured and then implanted into a recipient animal. In avian species this is not possible, so other methods have been developed for genome engineering in birds. The most common involves in vitro culturing of primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are cells that migrate through the embryonic circulatory system to the developing gonad and colonize the gonad, eventually differentiating into the gonadocytes which produce either sperm or ova. While in culture the PGCs can be modified to carry novel transgenes or gene edits, the population can be screened and enriched, and then transferred into a recipient embryo. The largest drawback of PGC culture is that culture methods do not transfer well across avian species, thus there are reliable culture methods for only a few species including the chicken. Two newer technologies that appear to be more easily adapted in a wider range of avian species are direct injection and sperm transfection assisted gene editing (STAGE). The direct injection method involves injecting genome engineering tools into the circulatory system of the developing embryo just prior to the developmental time point when the PGCs are migrating to the gonads. The genome engineering tools are complexed with transfection reagents, allowing for in vivo transfection of the PGCs. STAGE utilizes sperm transfection to deliver genome engineering tools directly to the newly fertilized embryo. Preliminary evidence indicates that both methodologies have the potential to be adapted for use in birds species other than the chicken, however further work is needed in this area.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundExtensive degradation of amino acids in the rumen via microbial deamination decreases\\xa0the post-ruminal availability of dietary indispensable amino acids. Together with the normal decrease in voluntary dry matter intake (DMI) around parturition in dairy cows, microbial metabolism contributes to a markedly negative balance of indispensable amino acids, including methionine which may\\xa0be the first-limiting for milk production. The main objective of the current study was to profile changes in major bacterial species with key functions in cellulose and hemicellulose digestion, xylan breakdown, proteolytic action, propionic acid production, lactate utilization and ruminal biohydrogenation in cows supplemented with rumen-protected Methionine (SM; Smartamine M, Adisseo NA, Alpharetta, GA, USA) from −23 through 30 d relative to parturition. Because ~90% of the methionine in SM bypasses the rumen, ~10% of the methionine is released into the rumen and can be utilized by microbes.ResultsAs expected, there was an increase in overall DMI after parturition (Day, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) during which cows consumed on average 19.6\\xa0kg/d versus 13.9\\xa0kg/d in the prepartum period. The postpartum diet contained greater concentrations of lipid and highly-fermentable carbohydrate from corn grain, which likely explains the increases in the relative\\xa0abundance of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, and Succinimonas amylolytica. Despite similar DMI prepartum, cows fed SM had greater (Treatment\\xa0× Day, P < 0.05)\\xa0abundance prepartum\\xa0of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Succinimonas amylolytica, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens. However, the greater DMI in cows fed SM after parturition (19.6\\xa0kg/d versus 13.9\\xa0kg/d) was associated with lower abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes (2.13 × 10−3 versus 2.25 × 10−4) and Selenomonas ruminantium (2.98 × 10−1 versus 4.10 × 10−1). A lower abundance (Day, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) was detected on d 20 compared with d\\xa0−10\\xa0for Fibrobacter succinogenes and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens. The relative abundance of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and Eubacterium ruminantium was stable across treatment and time.ConclusionsIn diets with proper balance of rumen-degradable protein and fermentable carbohydrate, the small fraction of Methionine released from the rumen-protected supplement did not seem to compromise growth of major bacterial species in the rumen. In fact, it had a positive effect on 3 major species prepartum when DMI was similar between groups. Because the actual requirements of Methionine (and Lysine, for example) by the cow during the transition period are unknown, it appears warranted to study the rumen microbiome as it relates to supply of rumen-protected amino acids.',\n",

In bulls, the spermatozoa present in the ejaculate are the result of a process that begun more than 2 mo earlier, bequeathing a delayed depiction of the actual function of the testis. Since testis vascularization might be critical for the gonad function, selected pulse wave Doppler ultrasound parameters were assessed in this study, for instance the peak systolic velocity, the end diastolic velocity and the resistive index of the testicular artery along the spermatic cord, the marginal portion of the testicular artery and the intratesticular branches of the testicular artery both in healthy adult and young bulls. Correlations between these parameters and characteristics of semen that was collected numerous times, before and after the Doppler ultrasound examination.ResultsThe peak systolic velocity and the end diastolic velocity measured in the testicular artery along the spermatic cord (supratesticular artery – SA) were variable among the bulls and within individual bulls, likely due to the convoluted course of the vessel. The resistive index was found highly repeatable in the same bull. A reduction in the resistive index was found between the supratesticular artery and the marginal portion of the testicular artery (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), and between the marginal portion of the testicular artery and the intratesticular branches of the testicular artery (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). No differences were recorded for the pulse wave Doppler ultrasound parameters in young bulls compared with adults. A significant correlation was found between the resistive index of the marginal portion of the testicular artery and total sperm in the ejaculate (r\\u2009=\\u20090.516, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), the immature sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.462, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), the teratoid sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.375, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and the “Dag defect” sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.389, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Similarly, the resistive index of the intratesticular branches of the testicular artery were found correlated with the total sperm number in the ejaculate (r\\u2009=\\u20090.568, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), the immature sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.523, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), the teratoid sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.418, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and the “Dag defect” sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.341, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe data presented in this study suggest that the resistive index, measured at the marginal portion of the testicular artery, could be an easy-to-perform parameter to evaluate the spermatogenesis quality in young bulls and normal adults.',\n",

PGCs are progenitor cells of gametes that can deliver genetic information to the next generation. Since avian PGCs were first discovered in nineteenth century, there have been numerous efforts to reveal their origin, specification, and unique migration pattern, and to improve germline transmission efficiency. Recent advances in the isolation and in vitro culture of avian PGCs with genetic manipulation and genome editing tools enable the development of valuable avian models that were unavailable before. However, many challenges remain in the production of transgenic and genome-edited birds, including the precise control of germline transmission, introduction of exogenous genes, and genome editing in PGCs. Therefore, establishing reliable germline-competent PGCs and applying precise genome editing systems are critical current issues in the production of avian models. Here, we introduce a historical overview of avian PGCs and their application, including improved techniques and methodologies in the production of transgenic and genome-edited birds, and we discuss the future potential applications of transgenic and genome-edited birds to provide opportunities and benefits for humans.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe production of transgenic farm animals (e.g., cattle) via genome engineering for the gain or loss of gene functions is an important undertaking. In the initial stages of genome engineering, DNA micro-injection into one-cell stage embryos (zygotes) followed by embryo transfer into a recipient was performed because of the ease of the procedure. However, as this approach resulted in severe mosaicism and has a low efficiency, it is not typically employed in the cattle as priority, unlike in mice. To overcome the above issue with micro-injection in cattle, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) was introduced and successfully used to produce cloned livestock. The application of SCNT for the production of transgenic livestock represents a significant advancement, but its development speed is relatively slow because of abnormal reprogramming and low gene targeting efficiency. Recent genome editing technologies (e.g., ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR-Cas9) have been rapidly adapted for applications in cattle and great results have been achieved in several fields such as disease models and bioreactors. In the future, genome engineering technologies will accelerate our understanding of genetic traits in bovine and will be readily adapted for bio-medical applications in cattle.',\n",

Dietary factors may affect the diversity, composition, and metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota. Among amino acids, proline is known to play important roles in protein metabolism and structure, cell differentiation, conceptus growth and development, and gut microbiota re-equilibration in case of dysbiosis.ResultsDietary supplementation with 1% proline decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) the amounts of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Peptostreptococcus productus, Pseudomonas, and Veillonella spp. in distal colonic contents than that in the control group. The colonic contents of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, Clostridium leptum subgroup, Escherichia coli, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, and Prevotella increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on d 70 of pregnancy as compared with those on d 45 of pregnancy. The colonic concentrations of acetate, total straight-chain fatty acid, and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the proline-supplemented group were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and butyrate level (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) decreased as compared with the control group. Almost all of the SCFA displayed higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentrations in proximal colonic contents on d 70 of pregnancy than those on d 45 of pregnancy. The concentrations of 1,7-heptyl diamine (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) and phenylethylamine (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in proximal colonic contents were higher, while those of spermidine (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) and total bioamine (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) tended to be lower in the proline-supplemented group than those in the control group. The concentrations of spermidine, spermine, and total bioamine in colonic contents were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on d 70 of pregnancy than those measured on d 45 of pregnancy. In contrast, the concentration of phenylethylamine was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on d 70 than on d 45 of pregnancy.ConclusionThese findings indicate that L-proline supplementation modifies both the colonic microbiota composition and the luminal concentrations of several bacterial metabolites. Furthermore, our data show that both the microbiota composition and the concentrations of bacterial metabolites are evolving in the course of pregnancy. These results are discussed in terms of possible implication in terms of luminal environment and consequences for gut physiology and health.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractPigs are an important resource in agriculture and serve as a model for human diseases. Due to their physiological and anatomical similarities with humans, pigs can recapitulate symptoms of human diseases, making them a useful model in biomedicine. However, in the past pig models have not been widely used partially because of the difficulty in genetic modification. The lack of true embryonic stem cells in pigs forced researchers to utilize genetic modification in somatic cells and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to generate genetically engineered (GE) pigs carrying site-specific modifications. Although possible, this approach is extremely inefficient and GE pigs born through this method often presented developmental defects associated with the cloning process. Advancement in the gene-editing systems such as Zinc-Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) system have dramatically increased the efficiency of producing GE pigs. These gene-editing systems, specifically engineered endonucleases, are based on inducing double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at a specific location, and then site-specific modifications can be introduced through one of the two DNA repair pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology direct repair (HDR). Random insertions or deletions (indels) can be introduced through NHEJ and specific nucleotide sequences can be introduced through HDR, if donor DNA is provided. Use of these engineered endonucleases provides a higher success in genetic modifications, multiallelic modification of the genome, and an opportunity to introduce site-specific modifications during embryogenesis, thus bypassing the need of SCNT in GE pig production. This review will provide a historical prospective of GE pig production and examples of how the gene-editing system, led by engineered endonucleases, have improved GE pig production. We will also present some of our current progress related to the optimal use of CRISPR/Cas9 system during embryogenesis.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn order to discover new strategies to replace antibiotics in the post-antibiotic era in meat-type chicken production, two new synbiotics were tested: (Lactobacillus salivarius IBB3154 plus galactooligosaccharide (Syn1) and Lactobacillus plantarum IBB3036 plus raffinose family oligosaccharides (Syn2).MethodsThe synbiotics were administered via syringe, using a special automatic system, into the egg air chamber of Cobb 500 broiler chicks on the 12th day of egg incubation (2 mg of prebiotics + 105 cfu bacteria per egg). Hatched roosters (total 2,400) were reared on an experimental farm, kept in pens (75 animals per pen), with free access to feed and water. After 42 d animals were slaughtered. Blood serum, pancreas, duodenum and duodenum content were collected.ResultsSyn2 increased trypsin activity by 2.5-fold in the pancreas and 1.5-fold in the duodenal content. In the duodenum content, Syn2 resulted in ca 30% elevation in lipase activity and 70% reduction in amylase activity. Syn1 and Syn2 strongly decreased expression of mRNA for GLP-1 and GIP in the duodenum and for GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas. Simultaneously, concentrations of the incretins significantly diminished in the blood serum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The decreased expression of incretins coincides with changed activity of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and in the duodenal content. The results indicate that incretins are involved in the action of Syn1 and Syn2 or that they may even be their target. No changes were observed in key hormones regulating metabolism (insulin, glucagon, corticosterone, thyroid hormones, and leptin) or in metabolic indices (glucose, NEFA, triglycerides, cholesterol). Additionally, synbiotics did not cause significant changes in the activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases in broiler chickens. Simultaneously, the activity of alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase diminished after Syn2 and Syn1, respectively.ConclusionThe selected synbiotics may be used as in ovo additives for broiler chickens, and Syn2 seems to improve their potential digestive proteolytic and lipolytic ability. Our results suggest that synbiotics can be directly or indirectly involved in incretin secretion and reception.',\n",

Two hundred and forty 1-day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement with two dietary B. coagulans levels (0 or 4\\u2009×\\u2009109\\xa0CFU/kg of diet) and two disease challenge statuses (control or NE challenged).ResultsNE-induced reduction in body weight gain was relieved by the addition of B. coagulans into broiler diets compared with the NE-infected birds. NE infection damaged intestinal morphological structure, promoted intestinal C. perfringens growth and liver invasion, and enhanced anti-C. perfringens specific sIgA concentrations in the gut and specific IgG levels in serum compared with the uninfected birds. NE infection significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) decreased mucin-2 (at 14 d post-infection (DPI), toll -like receptor 2 (TLR2, at 7 and 14 DPI), TLR4 (at 7 and 14 DPI), tumor necrosis factor super family 15 (TNFSF15, at 7 and 14 DPI), lysozyme (LYZ, at 14 DPI) and fowlicidin-2 (at 7 and 14 DPI) mRNA levels, whereas it dramatically (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) increased IFN-γ mRNA levels at 7 DPI. However, challenged birds fed diets supplemented with B. coagulans showed a significant (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) decrease in gut lesion scores, decreased C. perfringens numbers in the cecum and liver, and an increase in fowlicidin-2 mRNA levels in compared with the uninfected birds. In addition, compared with the non-supplemented group, dietary inclusion of B. coagulans improved intestinal barrier structure, further increased specific sIgA levels and alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity in the jejunum, enhanced the expression of jejunum lysozyme mRNA, and inhibited the growth, colonization, and invasion of C. perfringens; in contrast, it reduced serum-specific IgG concentrations and jejunum IFN-γ mRNA levels.ConclusionThese results indicated that dietary B. coagulans supplementation appeared to be effective in preventing the occurrence and reducing the severity of C. perfringens-induced NE in broiler chickens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundPolyamines stimulate DNA transcription and mRNA translation for protein synthesis in trophectoderm cells, as well as proliferation and migration of cells; therefore, they are essential for development and survival of conceptuses (embryo/fetus and placenta). The ovine conceptus produces polyamines via classical and non-classical pathways. In the classical pathway, arginine (Arg) is transformed into ornithine, which is then decarboxylated by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) to produce putrescine which is the substrate for the production of spermidine and spermine. In the non-classical pathway, Arg is converted to agmatine (Agm) by arginine decarboxylase (ADC), and Agm is converted to putrescine by agmatinase (AGMAT).MethodsMorpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MAOs) were designed and synthesized to inhibit translational initiation of the mRNAs for ODC1 and ADC, in ovine conceptuses.ResultsThe morphologies of MAO control, MAO-ODC1, and MAO-ADC conceptuses were normal. Double knockdown of ODC1 and ADC (MAO-ODC1:ADC) resulted in two phenotypes of conceptuses; 33% of conceptuses appeared to be morphologically and functionally normal (phenotype a) and 67% of the conceptuses presented an abnormal morphology and functionality (phenotype b). Furthermore, MAO-ODC1:ADC (a) conceptuses had greater tissue concentrations of Agm, putrescine, and spermidine than MAO control conceptuses, while MAO-ODC1:ADC (b) conceptuses only had greater tissue concentrations of Agm . Uterine flushes from ewes with MAO-ODC1:ADC (a) had greater amounts of arginine, aspartate, tyrosine, citrulline, lysine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, and glutamine, while uterine flushes of ewes with MAO-ODC1:ADC (b) conceptuses had lower amount of putrescine, spermidine, spermine, alanine, aspartate, glutamine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine.ConclusionsThe double-knockdown of translation of ODC1 and ADC mRNAs was most detrimental to conceptus development and their production of interferon tau (IFNT). Agm, polyamines, amino acids, and adequate secretion of IFNT are critical for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy during the peri-implantation period of gestation in sheep.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIt is well known that peptides play a vital role in the nutrition and health of dairy cows. Bovine oligopeptide transporter 1 (bPepT1) is involved in the peptide transport process in the gastrointestinal tracts of dairy cows. However, little information is known in the characteristics of bPepT1. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize bPepT1 functionally using a mammalian cell expression system. The uptake of radiolabeled dipeptide glycyl-sarcosine ([3H]-Gly-Sar) into the bPepT1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells was measured at various pH and substrate concentrations and with or without 15 other small peptides that contained Met or Lys.ResultsWestern blot results showed that the abundance of bPepT1 protein in the jejunum and ileum are the highest in the gastrointestinal tract of dairy cows. The uptake of [3H]-Gly-Sar by bPepT1-Chinese hamster ovary cells was dependent on time, pH, and substrate concentration, with a low Km value of 0.94\\u2009±\\u20090.06\\xa0mmol/L and a maximum velocity of 20.80\\u2009±\\u20091.74\\xa0nmol/(mg protein • 5\\xa0min). Most of the di- and tripeptides were the substrates of bPepT1, based on substrate-competitive studies. However, bPepT1 has a higher affinity to the peptides with shorter chains, greater hydrophobicity, and negative or neutral charges.ConclusionsThese results demonstrated for the first time the functional characteristics of bPepT1, and they provide a new insight and better understanding into its vital role in absorbing a wide range of peptides from the digestive tract of dairy cows.',\n",

Betaine is an important methyl donor that is reported to improve egg production of laying hens with an unclear mechanism. In the present study, we fed betaine-supplemented diet (0.5%) to laying hens for 4\\xa0wk and investigated its effect on VTGII expression in the liver.ResultsBetaine did not affect chicken weight, but significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) increased egg laying rate accompanied with a significant (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) increase in hepatic concentration and plasma level of VTGII. Plasma estrogen level did not change, but the hepatic expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα) mRNA was significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) up-regulated. Betaine did not affect the protein content of ERα, but significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) increased hepatic expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at both mRNA and protein levels. Also, ERα/GR interaction tended to be enhanced in the liver nuclear lysates of betaine-supplemented hens as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, dietary betaine supplementation significantly increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) the hepatic expression of methyl-transfer enzymes, such as BHMT, GNMT, and DNMT1, which was associated with higher SAM/SAH ratio and hypomethylation of GR promoter regions.ConclusionsBetaine activates hepatic VTGII expression in association with modified DNA methylation of GR gene promoter, GR expression and ERα/GR interaction. Activation of hepatic VTGII expression may contribute, at least partly, to improved egg production in betaine-supplemented hens.',\n",

Optimized culture conditions for gonocytes provide an opportunity for their study and in vitro manipulation for potential application in reproductive technologies. Using six experiments in a step-wise design, we examined the effects of several culture conditions on the maintenance, proliferation, and colony formation of porcine gonocytes. Testis cells from neonatal piglets were cultured for 7 d in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The examined culture conditions included using different cell seeding densities, gonocyte proportions, incubation temperatures, sampling strategies, and medium changing regimens.ResultsConfluency of cells was optimal (>90% by ~6 d) when 3.0\\u2009×\\u2009104 testis cells/cm2 containing ~40% gonocytes were used. Incubating the cells at 35\\xa0°C or 37\\xa0°C resulted in similar cell number and viability at confluency, but incubation at 35\\xa0°C resulted in a delayed confluency. In the first 2 d of culture, gonocytes remained mostly floating in the medium and gradually settled over the next 5 d. Consequently, not changing the medium for 7 d (as opposed to changing it every 2 d) led to a significant increase in the number of gonocyte colonies by reducing the loss of “floating gonocytes”.ConclusionWe found that gonocytes require the presence of a critical minimum number of somatic cells for settlement, and can proliferate and form growing colonies even in a basic medium. Large numbers of viable gonocytes remain floating in the medium for several days. The optimized culture conditions in the present study included seeding with 3.0\\u2009×\\u2009104 testis cells/cm2 containing ~40% gonocytes, incubating at 37\\xa0°C, and without changing the medium in the first week, which can result in improved colony formation of porcine gonocytes.',\n",

The nutritional requirements of unselected ducks may not be adequate, however, to fulfill the potential productivity performance of modern birds, including both meat-type and egg-type ducks. In particular, an imbalanced diet is associated with low productive performance and signs of nutritional deficiency (if insufficient nutrients are supplied), as well as with high feed costs and manure problems that reflect flock health and welfare (if excessive nutrients are supplied). Thus, the main aim of this review is to summarize the results of previous studies that estimated the nutrient requirements of meat-type and egg-type ducks in order to evaluate current knowledge and to identify further issues that need to be addressed.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundPrevious research has revealed a strong inflammatory response within adipose (AT) tissue during the transition into lactation. Whether this effect is a result of oxidative stress induced by lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation associated with differences in prepartum body condition score remains to be determined. The objectives of this study were to investigate systemic biomarkers of energy balance and inflammation and the expression of lipid metabolism- and inflammation-related genes in AT during the transition period in dairy cows.ResultsTwenty multiparous Holstein cows were retrospectively divided by body condition score (BCS) prior to parturition into two groups (10 cows/group): BCS\\u2009≤\\u20093.25 (LoBCS) and BCS\\u2009≥\\u20093.75 (HiBCS). Subcutaneous adipose tissue was biopsied from the tail-head region at d\\u2009−\\u200910, 7 and 20 relative to parturition. Plasma was used to evaluate biomarkers of\\xa0energy balance (EBAL) [free fatty acids (NEFA), glycerol, insulin] and inflammation [IL-1β, haptoglobin, myeloperoxidase, and reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM)]. Although insulin concentration was not affected by BCS, NEFA was overall greater and glycerol lower in HiBCS cows. Greater activity of myeloperoxidase in plasma coincided with increased haptoglobin and IL-1β postpartum in LoBCS cows. Among genes related with oxidative stress, the expression of the cytosolic antioxidant enzyme SOD1 was greater in LoBCS compared to HiBCS. Cows in LoBCS compared with HiBCS had greater overall expression of ABDH5 and ATGL along with ADIPOQ, indicating enhanced basal lipolysis and secretion of adiponectin. Expression of CPT1A, ACADVL, and ACOX1 was greater overall in HiBCS than LoBCS indicating enhanced NEFA oxidation. Although the temporal increase in plasma NEFA regardless of BCS coincided with the profile of CPT1A, the gradual decrease in genes related with re-esterification of NEFA (PCK1) and glycerol efflux (AQP7) coupled with an increase in glycerol kinase (GK) suggested some stimulation of NEFA utilization within adipose tissue. This idea is supported in part by the gradual decrease in insulin regardless of BCS. Although expression of the inflammation-related gene toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was greater in HiBCS versus LoBCS cows at −10 d, expression of TLR9 was greater in HiBCS versus LoBCS at 20 d. These profiles did not seem to be associated with concentrations of\\xa0pro-inflammatory biomarkers or ROM.ConclusionsOverall, data indicated that cows with BCS 3.25 or lower before calving experienced greater alterations in systemic inflammation and basal lipolysis without excessive increases in NEFA plasma concentrations. Despite the greater plasma NEFA around parturition, cows with BCS 3.75 or higher seemed to have a more active system for catabolism of NEFA and utilization of glycerol within adipose tissue. A linkage between those pathways and risk of disorders postpartum remains to be determined.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe use of feed grade amino acids can reduce the cost of lactation feed. With changing genetics, increasing feed costs, and higher number of pigs weaned with heavier wean weights further evaluation of higher inclusion levels of feed-grade amino acid in lactation diets than previously published is warranted. Two experiments (Exp.) were conducted to determine the optimal inclusion level of L-lysine HCl to be included in swine lactation diets while digestible lysine levels remain constant across dietary treatments and allowing feed grade amino acids to be added to the diet to maintain dietary ratios relative to lysine to maximize litter growth rate and sow reproductive performance. Furthermore, the studies were to evaluate minimal amino acid ratios relative to lysine that allows for optimal litter growth rate and sow reproductive performance.ResultsExp. 1: Increasing L-lysine HCl resulted in similar gilt feed intake, litter, and reproductive performance. Average litter gain from birth to weaning was 2.51, 2.49, 2.59, 2.43, and 2.65\\xa0kg/d when gilts were fed 0.00, 0.075, 0.150, 0.225, and 0.30% L-lysine HCl, respectively.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundAssociative data and some controlled studies suggest that the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α can induce fatty liver in dairy cattle. However, research demonstrating that TNFα is a necessary component in the etiology of bovine fatty liver is lacking. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether blocking TNFα signaling with a synthetic cyclic peptide (TNF receptor loop peptide; TRLP) would improve liver metabolic function and reduce triglyceride accumulation during feed restriction.ResultsCapability of TRLP to inhibit TNFα signaling was confirmed on primary bovine hepatocytes treated with recombinant bovine TNFα and 4 doses of TRLP (0, 1, 10, 50\\xa0μmol/L) over 24\\xa0h. Next, 4 lactating Holstein cows (parity 1.4\\u2009±\\u20090.5, 433\\u2009±\\u2009131\\xa0d in milk) in an incomplete Latin rectangle design (3\\u2009×\\u20092) were subcutaneously administered with different TRLP doses (0, 1.5, 3.0\\xa0mg/kg BW) every 4\\xa0h for 24\\xa0h, followed by an intravenous injection of TNFα (5\\xa0μg/kg BW). Before and for 2\\xa0h after TNFα injection, TRLP decreased plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05), suggesting an altered metabolic response to inflammation. Finally, 10 non-pregnant, non-lactating Holstein cows (3.9\\u2009±\\u20091.1\\xa0yr of age) were randomly assigned to treatments: control (carrier: 57% DMSO in PBS) or TRLP (1.75\\xa0mg TRLP /kg BW per day). Treatments were administrated every 4\\xa0h for 7 d by subcutaneous injection to feed-restricted cows fed 30% of maintenance energy requirements. Daily blood samples were analyzed for glucose, insulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, NEFA, and haptoglobin concentrations, with no treatment effects detected. On d 7, cows completed a glucose tolerance test (GTT) by i.v. administration of a dextrose bolus (300\\xa0mg glucose/kg BW). Glucose, insulin, and NEFA responses failed to demonstrate any significant effect of treatment during the GTT. However, plasma and liver analyses were not indicative of dramatic lipolysis or hepatic lipidosis, suggesting that the feed restriction protocol failed to induce the metabolic state of interest. Injection site inflammation, assessed by a scorer blinded to treatment, was enhanced by TRLP compared to control.ConclusionsAlthough the TRLP inhibited bovine TNFα signaling and altered responses to i.v. administration of TNFα, repeated use over 7 d caused apparent local allergic responses and it failed to alter metabolism during a feed restriction-induced negative energy balance. Although responses to feed restriction seemed atypical in this study, side effects of TRLP argue against its future use as a tool for investigating the role of inflammation in metabolic impacts of negative energy balance.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundPork produced by outdoor-reared pigs raised mostly on alfalfa pastures attracts increasing population of consumer from most of the world. In China, pigs were raised with alfalfa-containing diets to seek for good quality pork. However, the influence of dietary alfalfa involving high level of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) on pig intestinal luminal microbiota composition remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of alfalfa on luminal microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) production, and gene expressions involved in SCFA sensing, transporting and absorbing in pig caecal mucosa.ResultsTwenty-four growing pigs were randomly allotted to four diets containing 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% alfalfa meal for a 28-d experiment. Ingestion of alfalfa meal-contained diets significantly increased the ratio of body weight gain to feed consumption. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes showed that alfalfa-containing diet significantly decreased the relative abundance of genera Turicibacter, Acidiphilium, Paracoccus, Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Staphylococcus, and increased the relative abundance of genera Lachnospira, Marvinbryantia, and Desulfovibrio in the caecal digesta. Butyrate concentration was significantly increased in the hindgut by the supplementation of alfalfa meal in diets. The mRNA gene expressions of FFAR3, SMCT1, MCT1, PYY, and GCG were significantly increased in the caecal mucosa of pigs fed alfalfa meal.ConclusionsOur results suggested that alfalfa-containing diet has exerted significant impacts on caecal microbiota composition, butyrate concentration and significantly upregulated mRNA expression of host caecal mucosal genes involved in SCFA sensing and absorption as well as regulation of satiety.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractXylose, as β-1,4-linked xylan, makes up much of the hemicellulose in cell walls of cereal carbohydrates fed to pigs. As inclusion of fibrous ingredients in swine diets continues to increase, supplementation of carbohydrases, such as xylanase, is of interest. However, much progress is warranted to achieve consistent enzyme efficacy, including an improved understanding of the utilization and energetic contribution of xylanase hydrolysis product (i.e. xylooligosaccharides or monomeric xylose). This review examines reports on xylose absorption and metabolism in the pig and identifies gaps in this knowledge that are essential to understanding the value of carbohydrase hydrolysis products in the nutrition of the pig. Xylose research in pigs was first reported in 1954, with only sporadic contributions since. Therefore, this review also discusses relevant xylose research in other monogastric species, including humans. In both pigs and poultry, increasing purified D-xylose inclusion generally results in linear decreases in performance, efficiency, and diet digestibility. However, supplementation levels studied thus far have ranged from 5% to 40%, while theoretical xylose release due to xylanase supplementation would be less than 4%. More than 95% of ingested D-xylose disappears before the terminal ileum but mechanisms of absorption have yet to be fully elucidated. Some data support the hypothesis that mechanisms exist to handle low xylose concentrations but become overwhelmed as luminal concentrations increase. Very little is known about xylose metabolic utilization in vertebrates but it is well recognized that a large proportion of dietary xylose appears in the urine and significantly decreases the metabolizable energy available from the diet. Nevertheless, evidence of labeled D-xylose-1-14C appearing as expired 14CO2 in both humans and guinea pigs suggests that there is potential, although small, for xylose oxidation. It is yet to be determined if pigs develop increased xylose metabolic capacity with increased adaptation time to diets supplemented with xylose or xylanase. Overall, xylose appears to be poorly utilized by the pig, but it is important to consider that only one study has been reported which supplemented D-xylose dietary concentrations lower than 5%. Thus, more comprehensive studies testing xylose metabolic effects at dietary concentrations more relevant to swine nutrition are warranted.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundDairy cows can readily overconsume dietary energy during most of the prepartum period, often leading to higher prepartal concentrations of insulin and glucose and excessive body fat deposition. The end result of these physiologic changes is greater adipose tissue lipolysis post-partum coupled with excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and compromised health. Although transcriptional regulation of the adipose response to energy availability is well established in non-ruminants, such regulation in cow adipose tissue depots remains poorly characterized.ResultsEffects of ad-libitum access to high [HIGH; 1.62 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM)] or adequate (CON; 1.35 Mcal/kg of DM) dietary energy for 8 wk on mesenteric (MAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue transcript profiles were assessed in non-pregnant non-lactating Holstein dairy cows using a 13,000-sequence annotated bovine oligonucleotide microarray. Statistical analysis revealed 409 and 310 differentially expressed genes (DEG) due to tissue and diet. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA) with the KEGG pathway database. Compared with SAT, MAT had more active biological processes related to adipose tissue accumulation (adiponectin secretion) and signs of pro-inflammatory processes due to adipose tissue expansion and macrophage infiltration (generation of ceramides). Feeding the HIGH diet led to changes in mRNA expression of genes associated with cell hypertrophy (regucalcin), activation of adipogenesis (phospholipid phosphatase 1), insulin signaling activation (neuraminidase 1) and angiogenesis (semaphorin 4G, plexin B1). Further, inflammation due to HIGH was underscored by mRNA expression changes associated with oxidative stress response (coenzyme Q3, methyltransferase), ceramide synthesis (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1), and insulin signaling (interferon regulatory factor 1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1, retinoic acid receptor alpha). Activation of ribosome in cows fed HIGH indicated the existence of greater adipocyte growth rate (M-phase phosphoprotein 10, NMD3 ribosome export adaptor).ConclusionsThe data indicate that long-term ad-libitum access to a higher-energy diet led to transcriptional changes in adipose tissue that stimulated hypertrophy and the activity of pathways associated with a slight but chronic inflammatory response. Further studies would be helpful in determining the extent to which mRNA results also occur at the protein level.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe stomach is an underestimated key interface between the ingesta and the digestive system, affecting the digestion and playing an important role in several endocrine functions. The quality of starter microbiota and the early life feeding of medium chain triglycerides may affect porcine gastric maturation. Two trials (T1, T2) were carried out on 12 and 24 cesarean-delivered piglets (birth, d0), divided over two microbiota treatments, but slaughtered and sampled at two or three weeks of age, respectively. All piglets were fed orally: sow serum (T1) or pasteurized sow colostrum (T2) on d0; simple starter microbiota (Lactobacillus amylovorus, Clostridium glycolicum and Parabacteroides spp.) (d1-d3); complex microbiota inoculum (sow diluted feces, CA) or a placebo (simple association, SA) (d3-d4) and milk replacer ad libitum (d0-d4). The The T1 piglets and half of the T2 piglets were then fed a moist diet (CTRL); the remaining half of the T2 piglets were fed the CTRL diet fortified with medium chain triglycerides and 7% coconut oil (MCT). Total mRNA from the oxyntic mucosa was analyzed using Affymetrix©Porcine Gene array strips. Exploratory functional analysis of the resulting values was carried out using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.ResultsComplex microbiota upregulated 11 gene sets in piglets of each age group vs. SA. Of these sets, 6 were upregulated at both ages, including the set of gene markers of oxyntic mucosa. In comparison with the piglets receiving SA, the CA enriched the genes in the sets related to interferon response when the CTRL diet was given while the same sets were impoverished by CA with the MCT diet.ConclusionsEarly colonization with a complex starter microbiota promoted the functional maturation of the oxyntic mucosa in an age-dependent manner. The dietary fatty acid source may have affected the recruitment and the maturation of the immune cells, particularly when the piglets were early associated with a simplified starter microbiota.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe histone code is an established epigenetic regulator of early embryonic development in mammals. The lysine residue K9 of histone H3 (H3K9) is a prime target of SIRT1, a member of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase family of enzymes targeting both histone and non-histone substrates. At present, little is known about SIRT1-modulation of H3K9 in zygotic pronuclei and its association with the success of preimplantation embryo development. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of SIRT1 activity on H3K9 methylation and acetylation in porcine zygotes and the significance of H3K9 modifications for early embryonic development.ResultsOur results show that SIRT1 activators resveratrol and BML-278 increased H3K9 methylation and suppressed H3K9 acetylation in both the paternal and maternal pronucleus. Inversely, SIRT1 inhibitors nicotinamide and sirtinol suppressed methylation and increased acetylation of pronuclear H3K9. Evaluation of early embryonic development confirmed positive effect of selective SIRT1 activation on blastocyst formation rate (5.2\\xa0±\\xa02.9% versus 32.9\\xa0±\\xa08.1% in vehicle control and BML-278 group, respectively; P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). Stimulation of SIRT1 activity coincided with fluorometric signal intensity of ooplasmic ubiquitin ligase MDM2, a known substrate of SIRT1 and known limiting factor of epigenome remodeling.ConclusionsWe conclude that SIRT1 modulates zygotic histone code, obviously through direct deacetylation and via non-histone targets resulting in increased H3K9me3. These changes in zygotes lead to more successful pre-implantation embryonic development and, indeed, the specific SIRT1 activation due to BML-278 is beneficial for in vitro embryo production and blastocyst achievement.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundFeeding behavior study is important for animal husbandry and production. However, few studies were conducted on the feeding behavior and their relationship with feeding efficiency in Pekin ducks. In order to investigate the feeding behavior and their relationship with feed efficiency and other economic traits in Pekin ducks, we selected 358 male Pekin ducks and recorded feeding information between 3 to 6 wk of age using automatic electronic feeders, and compared the feeding behavior under different residual feed intake (RFI) levels.ResultsWe observed that total feed time, daily feed intake and feed intake per meal had strong positive correlations with feed efficiency traits; moreover, strong correlation between feed intake per meal and body weight was found (R=0.32, 0.36). Daily feeding rate meal and meal duration had weak correlations with feed efficiency (R=0.14~0.15). The phenotypic correlation of between-meal pauses, with feed efficiency was not observed. When daily changes were analyzed, high RFI ducks had the highest feed consumption over all times, and obvious differences in daily visits were found among different RFI level animals during the middle period; these differences were magnified with age, but there was no difference in daily meal number. Moreover, our data indicate that high RFI birds mainly take their meals at the edge of the population enclosure, where they are more susceptible to environmental interference.ConclusionsOverall, this study suggests that the general feeding behaviors can be accurately measured using automatic electronic feeders and certain feeding behaviors in Pekin ducks are associated with improved feed efficiency.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundDeoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species in the field, commonly found in cereal grains, which negatively affects performances and health of animals. Mycotoxin binders are supposed to reduce the toxicity of mycotoxins.MethodThe effect of a mycotoxin binder (containing acid-activated bentonite, clinoptilolite, yeast cell walls and organic acids) on growth performance and gut health was studied. Hundred and twenty weaning piglets were allocated to 4 treatments, with 5 pens of 6 piglets each, arranged in a 2\\xa0×\\xa02 factorial design: control diet; control diet with 1\\xa0kg/t binder; control diet with DON; and control diet with DON and 1\\xa0kg/t binder. From d0–14, the diet of DON-challenged groups was artificially contaminated with a mixture of DON (2.6\\xa0mg/kg), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (0.1\\xa0mg/kg) and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (0.3\\xa0mg/kg), after which the total contamination level was reduced to 1\\xa0mg/kg, until d37. On d14, one pig from each pen was euthanized and distal small intestinal mucosa samples were collected for the assessment of intestinal permeability, and gene expression of tight junction proteins, toll-like receptor 4, inflammatory cytokines and intestinal alkaline phosphatase.ResultsAfter 37 d, there were no differences in growth performance between control and DON-challenged groups (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05). Nevertheless, groups that received diets with binder had a significantly higher average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) for the first 14 d as well as for the whole period, compared to groups without binder (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). Groups with binder in the diet also exhibited lower expression of toll-like receptor 4 in distal small intestinal mucosa at d14, compared to groups without binder (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). Interestingly, comparing the two DON treatments, piglets fed DON and binder had significantly higher ADFI and ADG compared to those with only DON for the first 14-d (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). Addition of binder to DON contaminated diets, also down-regulated the gene expression of toll-like receptor 4 (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05) and increased mRNA level zona occludens 1 (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.10) as compared to DON.ConclusionsThe present data provide evidence that the binder improves growth rate in piglets associated with reduction of toll-like receptor-4 and increase of tight junction protein gene expression. However, the current study does not allow to assess whether the effects of the binder are mediated by alterations in the toxicokinetics of the mycotoxin.',\n",

Next, cows with a new corpus luteum 6 d after TAI were submitted to uterine biopsy procedure. Uterine fragments [CON (n\\xa0=\\xa06), ECP (n\\xa0=\\xa06)] were analyzed by RNA-Seq and a total of 135 transcripts were differentially expressed between groups (73 genes up-regulated by ECP treatment). Subsequently, uterine samples were analyzed by qPCR (genes associated with cell proliferation). ECP treatment induced greater abundance of PTCH2 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.07) and COL4A1 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.02), whereas suppressed EGFR (P\\xa0=\\xa00.09) expression. Conversely, eCG treatment increased abundance of HB-EGF (P\\xa0=\\xa00.06), ESR2 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.09), and ITGB3 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.05), whereas it reduced transcription of ESR1 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.05). Collectively, supplementation with ECP or eCG at the onset of proestrous of anestrous beef cows influenced ovarian responses, global and specific endometrial gene expression.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a gonadotropin synthesized and secreted by the pituitary gland. FSH stimulates follicle development and maturation in females. It also plays an important role in spermatogenesis in males, including humans and mice. However, the effects of FSH on male pigs are largely unknown. In this study, we generated transgenic pigs to investigate the effects of FSHα/β overexpression on reproductive traits in boars.ResultsAfter five transgenic F0 founders were crossed with wide-type pigs, 193\\xa0F1 animals were obtained. Of these, 96 were confirmed as transgenic. FSHα and FSHβ mRNAs were detected only in pituitary tissue. Transgenic boars exhibited significantly higher levels of FSHα and FSHβ mRNA, serum FSH, and serum testosterone, compared to full-sib non-transgenic boars. Significant increases in testis weight, vas deferens diameter, seminiferous tubule diameter, and the number of Leydig cells were observed, suggesting that the exogenous FSHα/β affects reproductive traits. Finally, transgenic and non-transgenic boars had similar growth performance and biochemical profiles.ConclusionsPituitary-specific overexpression of FSHα/β genes is likely to impact reproductive traits positively, as indicated by enhancements in serum testosterone level, testis weight, the development of vas deferens, seminiferous tubules, and Leydig cells in transgenic boars. A high level of serum FSH induces secretion of serum testosterone, possibly by boosting the number of Leydig cells, which presumably increases the libido and the frequency of sexual activity in transgenic boars. Our study provides a preliminary foundation for the genetic improvement of reproductive traits in male pigs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundInterleukin-1β (IL-1β) is important mediator of inflammatory-induced suppression of reproductive axis at the hypothalamic level. At the beginning of inflammation, the main source of cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is peripheral circulation, while over time, cytokines produced in the brain are more important. Melatonin has been shown to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines concentration in the brain. In ewes, melatonin is used to advance the onset of a breading season. Little is known about CSF concentration of IL-1β in ewes and its correlation with plasma during inflammation as well as melatonin action on the concentration of IL-1β in blood plasma and the CSF, and brain barriers permeability in early stage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation.MethodsSystemic inflammation was induced through LPS administration in melatonin- and sham-implanted ewes. Blood and CSF samples were collected before and after LPS administration and IL-1β and albumin concentration were measured. To assess the functions of brain barriers albumin quotient (QAlb) was used. Expression of IL-1β (Il1B) and its receptor type I (Il1r1) and type II (Il1r2) and matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp) 3 and 9 was evaluated in the choroid plexus (CP).ResultsBefore LPS administration, IL-1β was on the level of 62.0\\xa0±\\xa029.7\\xa0pg/mL and 66.4\\xa0±\\xa032.1\\xa0pg/mL in plasma and 26.2\\xa0±\\xa05.4\\xa0pg/mL and 21.3\\xa0±\\xa08.7\\xa0pg/mL in the CSF in sham- and melatonin-implanted group, respectively. Following LPS it increased to 159.3\\xa0±\\xa053.1\\xa0pg/mL and 197.8\\xa0±\\xa042.8\\xa0pg/mL in plasma and 129.8\\xa0±\\xa054.2\\xa0pg/mL and 139.6\\xa0±\\xa051.5\\xa0pg/mL in the CSF. No correlations was found between plasma and CSF IL-1β concentration after LPS in both groups. The QAlb calculated before LPS and 6\\xa0h after was similar in all groups. Melatonin did not affected mRNA expression of Il1B, Il1r1 and Il1r2 in the CP. The mRNA expression of Mmp3 and Mmp9 was not detected.ConclusionsThe lack of correlation between plasma and CSF IL-1β concentration indicates that at the beginning of inflammation the local synthesis of IL-1β in the CP is an important source of IL-1β in the CSF. Melatonin from slow-release implants does not affect IL-1β concentration in plasma and CSF in early stage of systemic inflammation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIt is well known that feeding a high concentrate (HC) diet to lactating ruminants likely induces subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) and leads to a decrease in milk fat production. However, the effects of feeding a HC diet for long periods on milk fatty acids composition and the mechanism behind the decline of milk fat still remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of feeding a HC diet to lactating dairy goats on milk fat yield and fatty acids composition with an emphasis on the mechanisms underlying the milk fat depression. Seventeen mid-lactating dairy goats were randomly allocated to three groups. The control treatment was fed a low-concentrate diet (35% concentrate, n\\xa0=\\xa05, LC) and there were two high-concentrate treatments (65% concentrate, HC), one fed a high concentrate diet for a long period (19 wks, n\\xa0=\\xa07, HL); one fed a high concentrate diet for a short period of time (4 wk, n\\xa0=\\xa05, HS). Milk fat production and fatty acids profiles were measured. In order to investigate the mechanisms underlying the changes in milk fat production and composition, the gene expression involved in lipid metabolism and DNA methylation in the mammary gland were also analyzed.ResultsMilk production was increased by feeding the HC diet in the HS and HL groups compared with the LC diet (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), while the percentage of milk fat was lower in the HL (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) but not in the HS group. The total amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in the milk was not changed by feeding the HC diet, whereas the levels of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were markedly decreased in the HL group compared with the LC group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Among these fatty acids, the concentrations of C15:0 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), C17:0 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), C17:1 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), C18:1n-9c (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), C18:3n-3r (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) and C20:0 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) were markedly lower in the HL group, and the concentrations of C20:0 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and C18:3n-3r (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) were lower in the HS group compared with the LC group. However, the concentrations of C18:2n-6c (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and C20:4n-6 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the milk fat were higher in the HS group. Real-time PCR results showed that the mRNA expression of the genes involved in milk fat production in the mammary gland was generally decreased in the HL and HS groups compared with the LC group. Among these genes, ACSL1, ACSS1 & 2, ACACA, FAS, SCD, FADS2, and SREBP1 were down-regulated in the mammary gland of the HL group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), and the expressions of ACSS2, ACACA, and FADS2 mRNA were markedly decreased in the HS goats compared with the LC group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). In contrast to the gene expression, the level of DNA methylation in the promoter regions of the ACACA and SCD genes was increased in the HL group compared with the LC group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). The levels of ACSL1 protein expression and FAS enzyme activity were also decreased in the mammary gland of the HL compared with the LC group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).ConclusionsLong-term feeding of a HC diet to lactating goats induced milk fat depression and FAs profile shift with lower MUFAs but higher SFAs. A general down-regulation of the gene expression involved in the milk fat production and a higher DNA methylation in the mammary gland may contribute to the decrease in milk fat production in goats fed a HC diet for long time periods.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundNutrition is one of the most important factors that affect animal performance, and it therefore also impacts on financial results in beef systems. In this way, finding the best strategy for feeding supplements is of paramount importance. Aiming to evaluate the effect of supplement feeding strategies for beef cows in the last third of gestation, two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, 35 pregnant Nellore cows were assigned to a completely randomized design with four treatments: control, which received no supplement; supplementation for the last 30\\xa0d of gestation (30-d; 3.0\\xa0kg/d); supplementation for the last 60\\xa0d of gestation (60-d; 1.5\\xa0kg/d); or supplementation for the last 90\\xa0d of gestation (90-d; 1.0\\xa0kg/d). All supplemented treatments received the same total amount of supplement throughout the experiment: 90\\xa0kg (20% of crude protein). A second experiment (Experiment 2) was delineated to evaluate the effects of the amounts offered in Experiment 1 on intake and metabolism. Four multiparous pregnant Nellore cows were assigned to a 4\\xa0×\\xa04 Latin square design, with periods of 15\\xa0d each.ResultsThere was a linear effect of the number of days of supplementation on calving body weight (BW; P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and a quadratic effect on BW change from parturition to d 31 post-calving (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), with cows on the 60-d strategy losing less BW post-calving. No difference was found in offspring birth BW (P\\xa0>\\xa00.10). A significant linear effect on interval from parturition to conception (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) was observed, with the highest calving to conception interval being observed in the 90-d strategy. The level of supplementation did not affect forage intake or neutral detergent fiber digestibility (P\\xa0>\\xa00.10). Nitrogen excreted through urine tended to increase linearly with the level of supplementation (P\\xa0<\\xa00.10).ConclusionProviding 1.5\\xa0kg of supplement during the last 60\\xa0d of gestation improves cow performance after calving, reducing the magnitude of BW lost, and reduces the number of days from calving to re-conception in the following breeding season compared to the usually recommended period of supplementation of 90\\xa0d pre-partum.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe lipid from egg yolk is largely consumed in supplying the energy for embryonic growth until hatching. The remaining lipid in the yolk sac is transported into the hatchling’s tissues. The gene expression profiles of fast- and slow-growing chickens, Arbor Acres (AA) and Beijing-You (BJY), were determined to identify global differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways related to lipid metabolism in the pectoralis major at hatching.ResultsBetween these two breeds, the absolute and weight-specific amounts of total yolk energy (TYE) and intramuscular fat (IMF) content in pectoralis major of fast-growing chickens were significantly higher (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01, P\\xa0<\\xa00.05, respectively) than those of the slow-growing breed. IMF content and u-TYE were significantly related (r\\xa0=\\xa00.9047, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). Microarray analysis revealed that gene transcripts related to lipogenesis, including PPARG, RBP7, LPL, FABP4, THRSP, ACACA, ACSS1, DGAT2, and GK, were significantly more abundant in breast muscle of fast-growing chickens than in slow-growing chickens. Conversely, the abundance of transcripts of genes involved in fatty acid degradation and glycometabolism, including ACAT1, ACOX2, ACOX3, CPT1A, CPT2, DAK, APOO, FUT9, GCNT1, and B4GALT3, was significantly lower in fast-growing chickens. The results further indicated that the PPAR signaling pathway was directly involved in fat deposition in pectoralis major, and other upstream pathways (Hedgehog, TGF-beta, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways) play roles in its regulation of the expression of related genes.ConclusionsAdditional energy from the yolk sac is transported and deposited as IMF in the pectoralis major of chickens at hatching. Genes and pathways related to lipid metabolism (such as PPAR, Hedgehog, TGF-beta, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways) promote the deposition of IMF in the pectoralis major of fast-growing chickens compared with those that grow more slowly. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism and deposition in hatchling chickens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe aim of this study was to estimate variance components and to identify genomic regions and pathways associated with resistance to gastrointestinal parasites, particularly Haemonchus contortus, in a breed of sheep adapted to tropical climate. Phenotypes evaluations were performed to verify resistance to gastrointestinal parasites, and were divided into two categories: i) farm phenotypes, assessing body condition score (BCS), degree of anemia assessed by the famacha chart (FAM), fur score (FS) and feces consistency (FC); and ii) lab phenotypes, comprising blood analyses for hematocrit (HCT), white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelets (PLT) and transformed (log10) egg per gram of feces (EPGlog). A total of 576 animals were genotyped with the Ovine SNP12k BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.), that contains 12,785 bialleleic SNP markers. The variance components were estimated using a single trait model by single step genomic BLUP procedure.ResultsThe overall linkage disequilibrium (LD) mean between pairs of markers measured by r2 was 0.23. The overall LD mean between markers considering windows up to 10\\xa0Mb was 0.07. The mean LD between adjacent SNPs across autosomes ranged from 0.02 to 0.10. Heritability estimates were low for EPGlog (0.11), moderate for RBC (0.18), PLT (0.17) HCT (0.20), HGB (0.16) and WBC (0.22), and high for FAM (0.35). A total of 22, 21, 23, 20, 26, 25 and 23 windows for EPGlog for FAM, WBC, RBC, PLT, HCT and HGB traits were identified, respectively. Among the associated windows, 10 were shown to be common to HCT and HGB traits on OAR1, OAR2, OAR3, OAR5, OAR8 and OAR15.ConclusionThe traits indicating gastrointestinal parasites resistance presented an adequate genetic variability to respond to selection in Santa Inês breed, and it is expected a higher genetic gain for FAM trait when compared to the others. The level of LD estimated for markers separated by less than 1\\xa0Mb indicated that the Ovine SNP12k BeadChip might be a suitable tool for identifying genomic regions associated with traits related to gastrointestinal parasite resistance. Several candidate genes related to immune system development and activation, inflammatory response, regulation of lymphocytes and leukocytes proliferation were found. These genes may help in the selection of animals with higher resistance to parasites.',\n",

To determine whether interactions between fatty acid (FA) metabolism and innate immunity may be associated with performance variations commonly seen within commercial broiler flocks, total carcass lipid %, carcass and blood FA composition, as well as genes involved with FA metabolism, immunity and cellular stress were investigated in male birds of a broiler strain, layer strain and F1 layer × broiler cross at d 14 post hatch. Heterophil: lymphocyte ratios, relative organ weights and bodyweight data were also compared.ResultsBroiler bodyweight (n\\xa0=\\xa012) was four times that of layers (n\\xa0=\\xa012) by d 14 and had significantly higher carcass fat percentage compared to the cross (n\\xa0=\\xa06; P\\xa0=\\xa00.002) and layers (P\\xa0=\\xa00.017) which were not significantly different from each other (P\\xa0=\\xa00.523). The carcass and whole blood FA analysis revealed differences in the FA composition between the three groups indicating altered FA metabolism, despite all being raised on the same diet. Genes associated with FA synthesis and β-oxidation were upregulated in the broilers compared to the layers indicating a net overall increase in FA metabolism, which may be driven by the larger relative liver size as a percentage of bodyweight in the broilers. Genes involved in innate immunity such as TLR2 and TLR4, as well as organelle stress indicators ERN1 and XBP1 were found to be non-significant, with the exception of high expression levels of XBP1 in layers compared to the cross and broilers. Additionally there was no difference in heterophil: lymphocytes between any of the birds.ConclusionsThe results provide evidence that genetic selection may be associated with altered metabolic processes between broilers, layers and their F1 cross. Whilst there is no evidence of interactions between FA metabolism, innate immunity or cellular stress, further investigations at later time points as growth and fat deposition increase would provide useful information as to the effects of divergent selection on key metabolic and immunological processes.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundBetaine affects fat metabolism in animals, but the specific mechanism is still not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate possible mechanisms of betaine in altering lipid metabolism in muscle tissue in finishing pigs.MethodsA total of 120 crossbred gilts (Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc) with an average initial body weight of 70.1\\xa0kg were randomly allotted to three dietary treatments. The treatments included a corn–soybean meal basal diet supplemented with 0, 1250 or 2500\\xa0mg/kg betaine. The feeding experiment lasted 42\\xa0d.ResultsBetaine addition to the diet significantly increased the concentration of free fatty acids (FFA) in muscle (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Furthermore, the levels of serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were decreased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and total cholesterol content was increased in muscle (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) of betaine fed pigs. Experiments on genes involved in fatty acid transport showed that betaine increased expression of lipoprotein lipase(LPL), fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation (FAT/CD36), fatty acid binding protein (FABP3) and fatty acid transport protein (FATP1) (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). The abundance of fatty acid transport protein and fatty acid binding protein were also increased by betaine (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). As for the key factors involved in fatty acid oxidation, although betaine supplementation didn’t affect the level of carnitine and malonyl-CoA, betaine increased mRNA and protein abundance of carnitine palmitransferase-1(CPT1) and phosphorylated-AMPK (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).ConclusionsThe results suggested that betaine may promoted muscle fatty acid uptake via up-regulating the genes related to fatty acid transporter including FAT/CD36, FATP1 and FABP3. On the other hand, betaine activated AMPK and up-regulated genes related to fatty acid oxidation including PPARα and CPT1. The underlying mechanism regulating fatty acid metabolism in pigs supplemented with betaine is associated with the up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid transport and fatty acid oxidation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe concept of foetal programming (FP) originated from human epidemiological studies, where foetal life nutrition was linked to health and disease status later in life. Since the proposal of this phenomenon, it has been evaluated in various animal models to gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying the foetal origins of health and disease in humans. In FP research, the sheep has been quite extensively used as a model for humans. In this paper we will review findings mainly from our Copenhagen sheep model, on the implications of late gestation malnutrition for growth, development, and metabolic and endocrine functions later in life, and discuss how these implications may depend on the diet fed to the animal in early postnatal life. Our results have indicated that negative implications of foetal malnutrition, both as a result of overnutrition and, particularly, late gestation undernutrition, can impair a wide range of endocrine functions regulating growth and presumably also reproductive traits. These implications are not readily observable early in postnatal life, but are increasingly manifested as the animal approaches adulthood. No intervention or cure is known that can reverse this programming in postnatal life. Our findings suggest that close to normal growth and slaughter results can be obtained at least until puberty in animals which have undergone adverse programming in foetal life, but manifestation of programming effects becomes increasingly evident in adult animals. Due to the risk of transfer of the adverse programming effects to future generations, it is therefore recommended that animals that are suspected to have undergone adverse FP are not used for reproduction. Unfortunately, no reliable biomarkers have as yet been identified that allow accurate identification of adversely programmed offspring at birth, except for very low or high birth weights, and, in pigs, characteristic changes in head shape (dolphin head). Future efforts should be therefore dedicated to identify reliable biomarkers and evaluate their effectiveness for alleviation/reversal of the adverse programming in postnatal life. Our sheep studies have shown that the adverse impacts of an extreme, high-fat diet in early postnatal life, but not prenatal undernutrition, can be largely reversed by dietary correction later in life. Thus, birth (at term) appears to be a critical set point for permanent programming in animals born precocial, such as sheep. Appropriate attention to the nutrition of the late pregnant dam should therefore be a priority in animal production systems.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundDuring late gestation the placental epithelial interface becomes highly folded, which involves changes in stromal hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is composed of glucoronate and N-acetyl-glucosamine. We hypothesized that supplementing gestating dams with glucosamine during this time would support placental folded-epithelial-bilayer development and increase litter size. In Exp. 1, gilts were unilaterally hysterectomized-ovariectomized (UHO). UHO gilts were mated and then supplemented daily with 10\\xa0g glucosamine (n\\xa0=\\xa016) or glucose (control, n\\xa0=\\xa017) from d 85 of gestation until slaughter (d 105). At slaughter, the number of live fetuses was recorded and each live fetus and its placenta was weighed. Uterine wall samples adjacent to the largest and smallest fetuses within each litter were processed for histology. In Exp. 2, pregnant sows in a commercial sow farm were supplemented with either 10\\xa0g glucosamine or glucose daily from d 85 of gestation to farrowing. Total piglets born and born alive were recorded for each litter. In Exp. 3, the same commercial farm and same protocol were used except that the dose of glucosamine and glucose was doubled to 20\\xa0g/d.ResultsIn Exp. 1, the number of live fetuses tended to be greater in glucosamine-treated UHO gilts (P\\xa0=\\xa00.098). Placental morphometry indicated that the width of the folded bilayer was greater (P\\xa0=\\xa00.05) in glucosamine-treated gilts. In Exp. 2, litter size did not differ between glucosamine- and glucose-treated sows. However in Exp. 3, the increased dose of glucosamine resulted in a significant treatment by parity interaction (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01), in which total piglets born and born alive were greater in glucosamine treated sows of later parity (5 and 6).ConclusionsThese results indicated that glucosamine supplementation increased the width of the folds of the placental bilayer and increased litter size in later parity, intact pregnant commercial sows.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundLeptin has a strong relation to important traits in animal production, such as carcass composition, feed intake, and reproduction. It is mainly produced by adipose cells and acts predominantly in the hypothalamus. In this study, circulating leptin and its gene expression in muscle were evaluated in two groups of young Nellore bulls with divergent feed efficiency. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) and average daily gain (ADG) of 98 Nellore bulls were evaluated in feedlot for 70 d to determinate the residual feed intake (RFI) and select 20 animals for the high feed efficient (LRFI) and 20 for the low feed efficient (HRFI) groups. Blood samples were collected on d 56 and at slaughter (80 d) to determine circulating plasma leptin. Samples of Longissimus dorsi were taken at slaughter for leptin gene expression levels.ResultsDMI and RFI were different between groups and LRFI animals showed less back fat and rump fat thickness, as well as less pelvic and kidney fat weight. Circulating leptin increased over time in all animals. Plasma leptin was greater in LRFI on 56 d and at slaughter (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0049). Gene expression of leptin were greater in LRFI animals (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0022) in accordance with the plasma levels. The animals of the LRFI group were leaner, ate less, and had more circulating leptin and its gene expression.ConclusionThese findings demonstrated that leptin plays its physiological role in young Nellore bulls, probably controlling food intake because feed efficient animals have more leptin and lower residual feed intake.',\n",

In this study, genome-wide associations were assessed for scrotal circumference at 210\\xa0d of age, scrotal circumference at 420\\xa0d of age, age at first calving, and age at second calving, in Canchim beef cattle. Data quality control was conducted resulting in 672,778 SNPs and 392 animals.ResultsAssociated SNPs were observed for scrotal circumference at 420\\xa0d of age (435 SNPs), followed by scrotal circumference at 210\\xa0d of age (12 SNPs), age at first calving (six SNPs), and age at second calving (four SNPs). We investigated whether significant SNPs were within genic or surrounding regions. Biological processes of genes were associated with immune system, multicellular organismal process, response to stimulus, apoptotic process, cellular component organization or biogenesis, biological adhesion, and reproduction.ConclusionsFew associations were observed for scrotal circumference at 210\\xa0d of age, age at first calving, and age at second calving, reinforcing their polygenic inheritance and the complexity of understanding the genetic architecture of reproductive traits. Finding many associations for scrotal circumference at 420\\xa0d of age in various regions of the Canchim genome also reveals the difficulty of targeting specific candidate genes that could act on fertility; nonetheless, the high linkage disequilibrium between loci herein estimated could aid to overcome this issue. Therefore, all relevant information about genomic regions influencing reproductive traits may contribute to target candidate genes for further investigation of causal mutations and aid in future genomic studies in Canchim cattle to improve the breeding program.',\n",

Immunofluorescence staining showed that 25\\xa0μmol/L CA promoted the localization of claudin-1 and claudin-3 to the plasma membrane without affecting the localization of other TJ proteins, including claudin-4, occludin, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3,\\xa0compared with the\\xa0control cells. Moreover, protein abundances for rBAT, xCT and LAT2 in IPEC-1 cells were enhanced by 25\\xa0μmol/L CA, while that for EAAT3 was not affected.ConclusionsCA improves\\xa0 intestinal mucosal barrier function by regulating the distribution of claudin-1 and claudin-3 in enterocytes, as well as enhancing\\xa0protein abundance for amino acid transporters rBAT, xCT and LAT2 in enterocytes.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundWhen an animal is exposed to a stressor, metabolic rate, energy consumption and utilisation increase primarily through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Changes to partitioning of energy by an animal are likely to influence the efficiency with which it is utilised. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the physiological stress response to an exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge in beef heifers divergently ranked on phenotypic residual feed intake (RFI).ResultsData were collected on 34 Simmental weaning beef heifers the progeny of a well characterized and divergently bred RFI suckler beef herd. Residual feed intake was determined on each animal during the post-weaning stage over a 91-day feed intake measurement period during which they were individually offered adlibitum grass silage and 2\\xa0kg of concentrate per head once daily. The 12 highest [0.34\\xa0kg DM/d] and 12 lowest [−0.48\\xa0kg DM/d] ranking animals on RFI were selected for use in this study. For the physiological stress challenge heifers (mean age 605\\xa0±\\xa013 d; mean BW 518\\xa0±\\xa031.4\\xa0kg) were fitted aseptically with indwelling jugular catheters to facilitate intensive blood collection. The response of the adrenal cortex to a standardised dose of ACTH (1.98\\xa0IU/kg metabolic BW0.75) was examined. Serial blood samples were analysed for plasma cortisol, ACTH and haematology variables. Heifers differing in RFI did not differ (P\\xa0=\\xa00.59) in ACTH concentrations. Concentration of ACTH peaked (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) in both RFI groups at 20\\xa0min post-ACTH administration, following which concentration declined to baseline levels by 150\\xa0min. Similarly, cortisol systemic profile peaked at 60\\xa0min and concentrations remained continuously elevated for 150\\xa0min. A RFI\\xa0×\\xa0time interaction was detected for cortisol concentrations (P\\xa0=\\xa00.06) with high RFI heifers had a greater cortisol response than Low RFI from 40\\xa0min to 150\\xa0min relative to ACTH administration. Cortisol response was positively associated with RFI status (r\\xa0=\\xa00.32; P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). No effect of RFI was evident for neutrophil, lymphocytes, monocyte, eosinophils and basophil count. Plasma red blood cell number (6.07 vs. 6.23; P\\xa0=\\xa00.02) and hematocrit percentage (23.2 vs. 24.5; P\\xa0=\\xa00.02) were greater for low than high RFI animals.ConclusionsEvidence is provided that feed efficiency is associated with HPA axis function and susceptibility to stress, and responsiveness of the HPA axis is likely to contribute to appreciable variation in the efficiency feed utilisation of cattle.',\n",

All cows received an intravenous injection of 4\\xa0mg TZD/kg of body weight (BW) daily from 2\\xa0wk after initiation of dietary treatments and for 2 additional week. Compared with CON cows and before TZD treatment, the OVE cows had lower concentration of total protein, urea and albumin over time. The concentration of cholesterol and tocopherol was greater after 2\\xa0wk of TZD regardless of diet. Before and after TZD, the OVE cows had greater concentrations of AST/GOT, while concentrations of paraoxonase, total protein, globulin, myeloperoxidase, and haptoglobin were lower compared with CON cows. Regardless of diet, TZD administration increased the concentration of ceruloplasmin, ROMt, cholesterol, tocopherol, total protein, globulin, myeloperoxidase and beta-carotene. In contrast, the concentration of haptoglobin decreased at the end of TZD injection regardless of diet. Prior to TZD injection, the mRNA expression of PC, ANGPTL4, FGF21, INSR, ACOX1, and PPARD in liver of\\xa0OVE cows was lower compared with CON cows. In contrast, the expression of HMGCS2 was greater in OVE compared with CON cows. After 1\\xa0wk of TZD administration the expression of IRS1 decreased regardless of diet; whereas, expression of INSR increased after 2\\xa0wk of TZD injection. Cows fed OVE had lower overall expression of TNF, INSR, PC, ACOX1, FGF21, and PPARD but greater HMGCS2 expression. These differences were most evident before and after 1\\xa0wk of TZD injection, and by 2\\xa0wk of TZD differences in expression for most genes disappeared.ConclusionsBased on molecular and blood data, administration of TZD enhanced some aspects of insulin sensitivity while causing contradictory results in terms of inflammation and oxidative stress. The bovine liver is TZD-responsive and level of dietary energy can modify the effects of TZD. Because insulin sensitizers have been proposed as useful tools to manage dairy cows during the transition period, further studies are required to investigate the potential hepatotoxicity effect of TZD (or similar compounds) in dairy cattle.',\n",

The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary methionine on growth performance, digestive and absorptive ability, as well as antioxidant capacity in the intestine and hepatopancreas of sub-adult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).ResultsDietary methionine deficiency significantly decreased percentage weight gain (PWG), feed intake, feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio, as well as activities of hepatopancreatic glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and muscle glutamate-pyruvate transaminase in sub-adult grass carp (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Furthermore, methionine deficiency significantly reduced activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase in the intestine, Na+/K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in three intestinal segments, and creatine kinase (CK) in the proximal intestine (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). However, an unexplained and significant increase in CK activity in the mid intestine was associated with dietary methionine deficiency. Malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in the intestine and hepatopancreas were significantly increased by methionine deficiency (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), whereas anti-hydroxyl radical capacity in the hepatopancreas and intestine, and anti-superoxide anion capacity in the intestine, were significantly decreased by methionine deficiency (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Moreover, methionine deficiency significantly decreased superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activities, glutathione contents in the hepatopancreas and intestine, as well as glutathione peroxidase activity in the intestine (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), whereas it significantly increased activities of catalase in the hepatopancreas and glutathione-S-transferase in the hepatopancreas and intestine (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).ConclusionsThe present results demonstrated that dietary methionine deficiency induced poor growth, and decreased digestive and absorptive function and antioxidant capacity in the hepatopancreas and intestine of sub-adult grass carp.

Eighteen litters of piglets (total 212) were randomly allocated to 2 groups and were fed a creep feed diet with or without in-feed antibiotics (olaquindox, oxytetracycline calcium and kitasamycin) from postnatal d 7 to d 42. On d 42, the piglets within the control or antibiotic group were mixed, respectively, and then further randomly assigned to a normal- (20%, 18%, and 14% CP from d 42 to d 77, d 77 to d 120, and d 120 to d 185, respectively) or a low-CP diet (16%, 14%, and 10% CP from d 42 to d 77, d 77 to d 120, and d 120 to d 185, respectively), generating 4 groups. On d 77 (short-term) and d 185 (long-term), serum and fecal samples were obtained for blood parameters, microbial composition and microbial metabolism analysis.ResultsEAI increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) albumin and glucose concentrations in low-CP diet on d 77, and increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) urea concentration in normal-CP diet. On d 185, EAI increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) globulin concentration in normal-CP diets, but decreased glucose concentration. For nutrient digestibility, EAI increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) digestibility of CP on d 77. For fecal microbiota, the EAI as well as low-CP diet decreased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) E. coli count on d 77. For fecal metabolites, on d 77, EAI decreased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) total amines concentration but increased skatole concentration in low-CP diet. On d 185, the EAI increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) putrescine and total amines concentrations in low-CP diets but reduced (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the normal-CP diets.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundMaternal obesity alters oocytes and subsequent fetal metabolism. An increasing number of studies have shown that the endoplasmic reticulums (ER) or mitochondria have important effects on oocyte quality, but there has been no study of the effect of mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) on oocyte quality. The present study was designed to assess whether the level of MAM and MAM-related proteins were different in oocytes from obese and control mice.ResultsFirst, oocytes from mice with high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity had higher levels (either greater numbers or a higher proportion for the same numbers) of MAM than oocytes from control mice. The abundance of MAM-related proteins in oocytes from obese mice was significantly greater at both the messenger RNA and protein levels, including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 1 (IP3R1), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 2 (IP3R2) and phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2). Further, there was an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) which was associated with increased apoptosis and compromised cytoplasmic maturation in oocytes from obese mice. Down-regulation of MAM-related protein IP3R1 in oocytes from obese mice decreased [Ca2+]m and apoptosis and improved cytoplasmic maturation but did not reduce the overall MAM level. However, down-regulating MAM-related protein PACS-2 in oocytes from obese mice did reduce the level of MAM and [Ca2+]m, which decreased the rate of apoptosis and improved cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes from obese mice.ConclusionsIt is possible that enriched MAM could increase [Ca2+]m, and this increase has been found to be associated with increased apoptosis and compromised cytoplasmic maturation in oocytes from obese mice. This finding suggests a novel therapeutic target for obesity-induced oocyte defects.',\n",

On the 42nd day of rearing the beneficial effect of synbiotic 1 was reflected by the numerically higher villi (no statistical differences) with a larger surface (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01) in the duodenum in the SYN1 group compare to the Control group. In the jejunum on the 1st day of life, in the SYN1 group, significantly higher villi than in the Control group, with a simultaneous decrease in the depth of crypts (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01), and also the largest width of villi and their absorbent area (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01) in comparison to the other groups were found. On the 42nd day of life, in the jejunum, an increase in the height of the villi whilst reducing the crypt depth in the SYN2 group was found (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01). In turn, in the SYN1 group, there were significantly more neutral goblet cells observed compared with the control group (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05).

This methodology allows for the estimation of marker effects at different levels of the variable of interest. We aimed to propose and evaluate a regularized quantile regression for SNP marker effect estimation of pig growth curves, as well as to identify the chromosome regions of the most relevant markers and to estimate the genetic individual weight trajectory over time (genomic growth curve) under different quantiles (levels).ResultsThe regularized quantile regression (RQR) enabled the discovery, at different levels of interest (quantiles), of the most relevant markers allowing for the identification of QTL regions. We found the same relevant markers simultaneously affecting different growth curve parameters (mature weight and maturity rate): two (ALGA0096701 and ALGA0029483) for RQR(0.2), one (ALGA0096701) for RQR(0.5), and one (ALGA0003761) for RQR(0.8). Three average genomic growth curves were obtained and the behavior was explained by the curve in quantile 0.2, which differed from the others.ConclusionsRQR allowed for the construction of genomic growth curves, which is the key to identifying and selecting the most desirable animals for breeding purposes. Furthermore, the proposed model enabled us to find, at different levels of interest (quantiles), the most relevant markers for each trait (growth curve parameter estimates) and their respective chromosomal positions (identification of new QTL regions for growth curves in pigs). These markers can be exploited under the context of marker assisted selection while aiming to change the shape of pig growth curves.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIntra-uterine crowding (IUC) observed in hyperprolific sows impairs myofiber hyperplasia and overall fetal growth. Arginine supplementation (ARG) in gestation diets has been shown to positively affect litter and muscle development. The study objective was to assess whether the effect of ARG on offspring characteristics, with special emphasis on myofiber hyperplasia, differs under IUC conditions from these responses, because in that situation growth retardation is particularly prevalent due to reduced fetal nutrient supply. Unilateral oviduct ligation (OL) was used as a model for an uncrowded and hyperprolificacy (IN) as a model for a crowded intra-uterine environment.MethodsFive OL and five IN sows were fed a diet supplemented daily with either 43 g l-alanine (Ctrl) or 25 g l-arginine from d 14 to 28 of gestation in a cross-over design (two periods: 5th and 6th parity). At farrowing, two male and two female offspring, respectively, with a low and intermediate birth weight (BtW) were selected. After euthanization, the Semitendinosus muscle (STM) was removed and weighed, and the light and dark portions (STMd and STMl) were prepared for myofiber histochemistry using ATPase staining and the entire STM for gene expression analysis of myogenesis-related genes using RT-qPCR. In addition, various organs were removed and weighed. Data were analyzed using the MIXED model in SYSTAT.ResultsNo effect of either IUC or dietary treatment was found in litter characteristics. Offspring of ARG sows displayed a greater muscle area in STM (P < 0.01) as a result of the greater myofiber hyperplasia (P < 0.01). The increase was more distinct in the STMl (P < 0.05) than in the STMd (P = 0.131). Offspring of OL sows were heavier at birth (P < 0.01), had a heavier STM (P < 0.05), liver (P < 0.01) and kidney (P < 0.05), but when expressed relative to birth weight, these differences were absent. In addition, IUC had an effect (P < 0.05) on the expression of one of the myogenesis-related genes investigated.ConclusionsIndependent from the extent of IUC, ARG improved BtW, muscle and organ weights and myofiber hyperplasia in offspring.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe objective of the present study was to estimate (co)variance components of female fertility traits in Chinese Holsteins, considering fertility traits in different parities as different traits. Data on 88,647 females with 215,632 records (parities) were collected during 2000 to 2014 from 32 herds in the Sanyuan Lvhe Dairy Cattle Center, Beijing, China. The analyzed female fertility traits included interval from calving to first insemination, interval from first to last insemination, days open, conception rate at first insemination, number of inseminations per conception and non-return rates within 56 days after first insemination.ResultsThe descriptive statistics showed that the average fertility of heifers was superior to that of cows. Moreover, the genetic correlations between the performances of a trait in heifers and in cows were all moderate to high but far from one, which suggested that the performances of a trait in heifers and cows should be considered as different but genetically correlated traits in genetic evaluations. On the other hand, genetic correlations between performances of a trait in different parities of cows were greater than 0.87, with only a few exceptions, but variances were not homogeneous across parities for some traits. The estimated heritabilities of female fertility traits were low; all were below 0.049 (except for interval from calving to first insemination). Additionally, the heritabilities of the heifer interval traits were lower than those of the corresponding cow interval traits. Moreover, the heritabilities of the interval traits were higher than those of the threshold traits when measuring similar fertility functions. In general, estimated genetic correlations between traits were highly consistent with the biological categories of the female fertility traits.ConclusionsInterval from calving to first insemination, interval from first to last insemination and non-return rates within 56 days after first insemination are recommended to be included in the selection index of the Chinese Holstein population. The parameters estimated in the present study will facilitate the development of a genetic evaluation system for female fertility traits to improve the reproduction efficiency of Chinese Holsteins.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundTwo trials were performed to evaluate a partially defatted Hermetia illucens (HI) larvae meal as potential feed ingredient in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) diets. In the first trial, 360 trout (178.9\\xa0±\\xa09.8\\xa0g of mean initial body weight) were randomly divided into three experimental groups (4 tanks/treatment, 30 fish/tank). The fish were fed for 78 days with isonitrogenous, isolipidic and isoenergetic diets containing increasing levels of HI, on as fed basis: 0% (HI0, control diet), 25% (HI25) and 50% (HI50) of fish meal substitution, corresponding to dietary inclusion levels of 0, 20% and 40%. In the second trial, 36 trout (4 tanks/treatment, 3 fish/tank) were used to evaluate the in vivo apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of the same diets used in the first trial.ResultsSurvival, growth performance, condition factor, somatic indexes, and dorsal fillet physical quality parameters were not affected by diet. The highest dietary inclusion of HI larvae meal increased dry matter and ether extract contents of trout dorsal fillet. The use of HI larvae meal induced a decrease of valuable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) even if differences were only reported at the highest level of HI inclusion. The insect meal worsened the lipids health indexes of the same muscle. Dietary inclusion of insect meal did not alter the villus height of the fish. No differences were found among treatments in relation to ADC of ether extract and gross energy, while ADC of dry matter and crude protein were higher in HI25 if compared to HI50.ConclusionsThe obtained results showed that a partially defatted HI larvae meal can be used as feed ingredient in trout diets up to 40% of inclusion level without impacting survival, growth performance, condition factor, somatic indexes, dorsal fillet physical quality parameters, and intestinal morphology of the fish. However, further investigations on specific feeding strategies and diet formulations are needed to limit the observed negative effects of the insect meal on the FA composition of dorsal muscle.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn beef cattle, changes in the periovulatory endocrine milieu are associated with fertility and conceptus growth. A large preovulatory follicle (POF) and the resulting elevated concentrations of progesterone (P4) during diestrus positively affect pregnancy rates. Amino acids (AA) are important components of maternally derived secretions that are crucial for embryonic survival before implantation. The hypothesis is that the size of the POF and the concentration of P4 in early diestrus modulate the endometrial abundance of SLC transcripts related to AA transport and metabolism and subsequently impact luminal concentrations of AA. The follicle growth of Nelore cows was manipulated to produce two experimental groups: large POF and CL (LF-LCL group) and small POF and CL (SF-SCL group). On Day 4 (D4; Experiment 1) and Day 7 (D7; Experiment 2) after GnRH-induced ovulation (GnRH treatment\\u2009=\\u2009D0), the animals were slaughtered and uterine tissues and uterine washings were collected. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression levels of AA transporters in D4 and D7 endometrial tissues. The concentrations of AA were quantified in D4 and D7 uterine washings by HPLC.ResultsTranscript results show that, on D4, SLC6A6, SLC7A4, SLC17A5, SLC38A1, SLC38A7 and SCLY and on D7 SLC1A4, SLC6A1, SLC6A14, SLC7A4, SLC7A7, SLC7A8, SLC17A5, SLC38A1, SLC38A7, SLC43A2 and DDO were more abundant in the endometria of cows from the LF-LCL group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, concentrations of AA in the uterine lumen were influenced by the endocrine profiles of the mother. In this context, D4 uterine washings revealed that greater concentrations of taurine, alanine and α-aminobutyric acid were present in SF-SCL (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In contrast, lower concentrations of valine and cystathionine were quantified on D7 uterine washings from SF-SCL cows (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionThe present study revealed an association between the abundance of transcripts related to AA transport and metabolism in the endometrium and specific periovulatory endocrine profiles related to the receptive status of the mother. Such insights suggest that AAs are involved in uterine function to support embryo development.',\n",

Different strains from the same species may exert different weight-gain effect on hosts in vivo. Most lactobacilli are selected based on their in vitro activities, and their metabolism and regulation on the intestine based on strain-related characters are largely unexplored. The objective of the present study was to study the in vivo effects of the three lactobacilli on growth performance and to compare the differential effects of the strains on the faecal microbiota and ileum mucosa proteomics of piglets.MethodsThree hundred and sixty piglets were assigned to one of four treatments, which included an antibiotics-treated control and three experimental groups supplemented with the three lactobacilli, L. salivarius G1-1, L. reuteri G8-5 and L. reuteri G22-2, respectively. Piglets were weighed and the feed intake was recorded to compare the growth performance. The faecal lactobacilli and coliform was quantified using quantitative PCR and the faecal microbiota was profiled by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The proteomic approach was applied to compare the differential expression of proteins in the ileum mucosa.ResultsNo statistical difference was found among the three Lactobacillus-treated groups in animal growth performance compared with the antibiotics-treated group (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Supplementation of lactobacilli in diets significantly increased the relative 16S rRNA gene copies of Lactobacillus genus on both d 14 and d 28 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05)., and the bacterial community profiles based on DGGE from the lactobacilli-treated groups were distinctly different from the antibiotics-treated group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The ileum mucosa of piglets responded to all Lactobacillus supplementation by producing more newly expressed proteins and the identified proteins were all associated with the functions beneficial for stabilization of cell structure. Besides, some other up-regulated and down-regulated proteins in different Lactobacillus-treated groups showed the expression of proteins were partly strain-related.ConclusionsAll the three lactobacilli in this study show comparable effects to antibiotics on piglets growth performance. The three lactobacilli were found able to modify intestinal microbiota and mucosa proteomics. The regulation of protein expression in the intestinal mucosa are partly associated with the strains administrated in feed.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCorn and soybean meal (SBM) are two of the most common feed ingredients used in pig feeds. However, a variety of antinutritional factors (ANFs) present in corn and SBM can interfere with the bioavailability of nutrients and have negative health effects on the pigs. In the present study, two-stage fermentation using Bacillus subtilis followed by Enterococcus faecium was carried out to degrade ANFs and improve the nutritional quality of corn and SBM mixed feed. Furthermore, the microbial composition and in vitro nutrient digestibility of inoculated mixed feed were determined and compared those of the uninoculated controls.ResultsDuring the fermentation process, B. subtilis and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were the main dominant bacteria in the solid-state fermented inoculated feed, and fermentation produced a large amount of lactic acid (170 mmoL/kg), which resulted in a lower pH (5.0 vs. 6.4) than the fermented uninoculated feed. The amounts of soybean antigenic proteins (β-conglycinin and glycinin) in mixed feed were significantly decreased after first-stage fermentation with B. subtilis. Inoculated mixed feed following two-stage fermentation contained greater concentratioin of crude protein (CP), ash and total phosphorus (P) compared to uninoculated feed, whereas the concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), hemicellulose and phytate P in fermendted inoculated feed declined (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by 38%, 53%, and 46%, respectively. Notably, the content of trichloroacetic acid soluble protein (TCA-SP), particularly that of small peptides and free amino acids (AA), increased 6.5 fold following two-stage fermentation. There was no difference in the total AA content between fermented inoculated and uninoculated feed. However, aromatic AAs (Phe and Tyr) and Lys in inoculated feed increased, and some polar AAs, including Arg, Asp, and Glu, decreased compared with the uninoculated feed. In vitro dry matter and CP digestibility of inoculated feed improved (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared with the uninoculated feed.ConclusionsOur results suggest that two-stage fermentation using B. subtilis followed by E. faecium is an effective approach to improve the quality of corn-soybean meal mixed feed.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe aim of the study was to analyze the lifetime and culling reasons for boars used in insemination centers (AI centers).MethodsThe data collected from 355 culled boars from 1998 to 2013 included: age at start of semen collection, boar herd life, culling reason, daily gain and lean meat content, and number of ejaculates not meeting sales requirements after dilution. Culling reasons were divided into 7 groups: low semen value (LSV), low or lack of libido (LL), leg problems (LP), infectious diseases (ID), old age (OA), reduced demand for semen from the given boar (RD), and others (OT).ResultsThe most common culling reasons for boars were LSV (23.7%) and RD (22.5%). It was observed that the lowest daily gains were noted in boars culled due to OA. Boars culled due to OA and RD were maintained in production for the longest time (over 1000 d), for LSV and ID retention was about 700 d, and due to LL below 400 d. The survival probability was over 0.9 until 1.5\\xa0yr, and just over 0.2 until 4\\xa0yr. The highest relative frequency was observed in the 36th and 42nd mo of life (over 16%). Hazard risk analysis revealed a more than 10 times higher risk of culling in the case of LL, ID or OT, in comparison to OA.ConclusionsThe results can be used as a direct point of reference for the identification of emerging problems in AI boar exploitation and the development of an appropriate culling policy in AI centers.',\n",

The experimental diets were: a basal diet and two diets prepared by substituting 250\\xa0g/kg (w/w) of the basal diet with BSFp or BSFh, respectively.ResultsSignificant differences were found between BSFp and BSFh meals for ATTDC of the nutrients: BSFp resulted more digestible than BSFh, except for ATTDC of CP which did not differed between meals, while a statistical trend was observed for ATTDC of DM and EE. The AME and AMEn values were significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) different between the two BSF meals, with higher levels for BSFp (16.25 and 14.87\\xa0MJ/kg DM, respectively). The AIDC of the AA in BSFp ranged from 0.44 to 0.92, while in BSFh they ranged from 0.45 to 0.99.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractA conventional diet based on corn and soybean meal fed to pigs is usually provided in a mash form and in most cases, processing other than grinding and mixing is not used. However, due to the high cost of energy in pig diets, use of high fiber ingredients such as soybean hulls, distillers dried grains with solubles, and wheat middlings has increased. High fiber concentrations in the diet usually results in reduced energy and nutrient digestibility due to the low capacity of pigs to digest fiber, which negatively impacts growth performance and carcass composition of the pigs. Feed processing technologies such as changes in grinding procedures, expansion, extrusion, pelleting, use of enzymes or chemical treatments may, however, be used to solubilize some of the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions that form the cell wall of plants in the ingredients, and therefore, increase nutrient availability. This may have a positive effect on energy digestibility, and therefore, also on pig growth performance and carcass composition, but effects of different feed technologies on the nutritional value of feed ingredients and diets fed to pigs are not fully understood. It has however, been demonstrated that reduced particle size of cereal grains usually results in increased digestibility of energy, primarily due to increased digestibility of starch. Extrusion or expansion of ingredients or diets may also increase energy digestibility and it appears that the increase is greater in high fiber diets than in diets with lower concentrations of fiber. Chemical treatments have not consistently improved energy or nutrient digestibility, but a number of different enzymes may be used to increase the digestibility of phosphorus, calcium, or energy. Thus, there are several opportunities for using feed technology to improve the nutritional value of diets fed to pigs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe present experiment was performed to assess the effects of different sources of milk on the growth performance, serum metabolism, immunity, and intestinal development of calves. Eighty-four Holstein male neonatal calves were assigned to one of the following four treatment groups: those that received bunk tank milk (BTM), untreated waste milk (UWM), pasteurized waste milk (PWM), and acidified waste milk (AWM) for 21 d.ResultsCalves in the BTM and AWM groups consumed more starter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than those in the UWM group. Average daily gain in the UWM group was the highest (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Calves exhibited the highest (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) serum total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, growth hormone, immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM concentrations in the UWM group, highest malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-α in the PWM group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and highest glutathione peroxidase and IgG in the BTM group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The jejunum and ileum of the calves in all treatments presented a slight inflammatory response. The jejunal inflammation scores were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the UWM and AWM groups than the BTM group; the ileal inflammation scores increased more (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the AWM group than the BTM group. Jejunal immunohistochemical scores (IHS) were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the PWM and AWM groups than the BTM group. Compared to the other three groups, calves feeding on BTM had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) ileal IHS. Jejunal interleukin(IL)-1β, IL-8, and IL-10 mRNA expression in the UWM group was the highest (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Calves fed AWM increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) mRNA expression of IL-8 and toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in the jejunum and IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in the mesenteric lymph nodes.ConclusionsOverall, bunk tank milk is the best choice for calf raising compared to waste milk. The efficiency of feeding pasteurized and acidified waste milk are comparable, and the acidification of waste milk is an acceptable labor-saving and diarrhea-preventing feed for young calves.',\n",

The pyrosequencing results showed that a total of 208 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were formed from ten samples at 99% sequence identity. All the sequences were identified as Methanomassiliicoccaceae at the family level, and most of the sequences (96.82%\\u2009±\\u20091.64%) were further classified as Group 8, 9, and 10 at the Methanomassiliicoccales genus level in each sample based on the RIM-DB database. No significant differences were observed in the number of OTUs or Chao1’s, Shannon’s or Pielou’s evenness indexes between the hay- and high-grain-diet groups (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.05).

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractFluoroacetate producing plants grow worldwide and it is believed they produce this toxic compound as a defence mechanism against grazing by herbivores. Ingestion by livestock often results in fatal poisonings, which causes significant economic problems to commercial farmers in many countries such as Australia, Brazil and South Africa. Several approaches have been adopted to protect livestock from the toxicity with limited success including fencing, toxic plant eradication and agents that bind the toxin. Genetically modified bacteria capable of degrading fluoroacetate have been able to protect ruminants from fluoroacetate toxicity under experimental conditions but concerns over the release of these microbes into the environment have prevented the application of this technology. Recently, a native bacterium from an Australian bovine rumen was isolated which can degrade fluoroacetate. This bacterium, strain MFA1, which belongs to the Synergistetes phylum degrades fluoroacetate to fluoride ions and acetate. The discovery and isolation of this bacterium provides a new opportunity to detoxify fluoroacetate in the rumen. This review focuses on fluoroacetate toxicity in ruminant livestock, the mechanism of fluoroacetate toxicity, tolerance of some animals to fluoroaceate, previous attempts to mitigate toxicity, aerobic and anaerobic microbial degradation of fluoroacetate, and future directions to overcome fluoroacetate toxicity.',\n",

The beneficial effect of these bioactive substances on the gastrointestinal tract and immune system give rise to improvements in broiler health and performance nutrition, thus increasing the productivity of these birds. An innovative method for introducing bioactive substances into chickens is the in ovo injection into eggs intended for hatching. The aim of the study was to evaluate the development of histomorphological parameters of the duodenum and productivity in chickens injected in ovo with the prebiotic DiNovo® (extract of Laminaria species of seaweed, BioAtlantis Ltd., Ireland) on d 12 of incubation, under large - scale, high density poultry production conditions.ResultsThere was no significant impact of the injection of DiNovo® prebiotic on the production parameters of broiler chickens (body weight, FCR, EBI and mortality) obtained on d 42 of rearing. No significant impact of the DiNovo® injection on the duodenum weight and length was observed, as well as on the CSA, diameter and muscular layer thickness of the duodenum. The in ovo injection of DiNovo® significantly increased the width of the duodenal villi (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and crypt depth (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) of chickens on d 21 of rearing. Other histomorphological parameters of duodenal villi at d 42 of chickens rearing such as: the height, width, and cross section area of villi were significantly greater in chickens from the control group compared to those from the DiNovo® group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 and P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).ConclusionsIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that injection of DiNovo® prebiotic into the air chamber of egg significantly influences the histomorphological parameters on d 21 of rearing without negatively affecting productivity in chickens at the end of rearing.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe growth rate often varies among individual broilers of the same breed under a common management condition. To investigate whether a variation in the growth rate is associated with a difference in hormone levels and myogenic gene expression profile in broilers, a feeding trial was conducted with 10,000 newly hatched Ross 308 chicks in a commercial production facility under standard management. At 38 d of age, 30 fast-, 30 medium-, and 30 slow-growing broilers were selected among 600 healthy male individuals. The levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and growth hormone in the serum or breast muscle were assayed by ELISA or RIA kits, and the expression levels of several representative pro- and anti-myogenic genes in the breast muscle were also measured by real-time PCR.ResultsResults showed that both absolute and relative weights of the breast muscle were in linear positive correlations with the body weight of broilers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Fast-growing broilers had higher concentrations of IGF-1 than slow-growing broilers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in both the serum and breast muscle. The serum concentration of T3 was significantly higher in fast-growing birds than in slow-growing birds (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). However, no difference was observed in growth hormone or T4 concentration among three groups of birds. Additionally, a decreased expression of an anti-myogenic gene (myostatin) and increased expressions of pro-myogenic genes such as myogenic differentiation factor 1, myogenin, muscle regulatory factor 4, myogenic factor 5, IGF-1, and myocyte enhancer factor 2B, C, and D were observed in fast-growing broilers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), relative to slow-growing broilers.ConclusionsCollectively, these findings suggested that the growth rate is linked to the hormone and myogenic gene expression levels in broiler chickens. Some of these parameters such as serum concentrations of IGF-1 and T3 could be employed to breed for enhanced growth.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMaternal undernutrition or overnutrition during pregnancy alters organ structure, impairs prenatal and neonatal growth and development, and reduces feed efficiency for lean tissue gains in pigs. These adverse effects may be carried over to the next generation or beyond. This phenomenon of the transgenerational impacts is known as fetal programming, which is mediated by stable and heritable alterations of gene expression through covalent modifications of DNA and histones without changes in DNA sequences (namely, epigenetics). The mechanisms responsible for the epigenetic regulation of protein expression and functions include chromatin remodeling; DNA methylation (occurring at the 5´-position of cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides); and histone modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination). Like maternal malnutrition, undernutrition during the neonatal period also reduces growth performance and feed efficiency (weight gain:feed intake; also known as weight-gain efficiency) in postweaning pigs by 5–10%, thereby increasing the days necessary to reach the market body-weight. Supplementing functional amino acids (e.g., arginine and glutamine) and vitamins (e.g., folate) play a key role in activating the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and regulating the provision of methyl donors for DNA and protein methylation. Therefore, these nutrients are beneficial for the dietary treatment of metabolic disorders in offspring with intrauterine growth restriction or neonatal malnutrition. The mechanism-based strategies hold great promise for the improvement of the efficiency of pork production and the sustainability of the global swine industry.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractElevated concentrations of plasma fatty acids in transition dairy cows are significantly associated with increased disease susceptibility and poor lactation performance. The main source of plasma fatty acids throughout the transition period is lipolysis from adipose tissue depots. During this time, plasma fatty acids serve as a source of calories mitigating the negative energy balance prompted by copious milk synthesis and limited dry matter intake. Past research has demonstrated that lipolysis in the adipose organ is a complex process that includes not only the activation of lipolytic pathways in response to neural, hormonal, or paracrine stimuli, but also important changes in the structure and cellular distribution of the tissue in a process known as adipose tissue remodeling. This process involves an inflammatory response with immune cell migration, proliferation of the cellular components of the stromal vascular fraction, and changes in the extracellular matrix. This review summarizes current knowledge on lipolysis in dairy cattle, expands on the new field of adipose tissue remodeling, and discusses how these biological processes affect transition cow health and productivity.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractPrecise knowledge of the actual nutritional value of individual feedstuffs and complete diets for pigs is important for efficient livestock production. Methods of assessment of protein and energy values in pig feeds have been briefly described. In vivo determination of protein and energy values of feeds in pigs are time-consuming, expensive and very often require the use of surgically-modified animals. There is a need for more simple, rapid, inexpensive and reproducible methods for routine feed evaluation. Protein and energy values of pig feeds can be estimated using the following alternative methods: 1) prediction equations based on chemical composition; 2) animal models as rats, cockerels and growing pigs for adult animals; 3) rapid methods, such as the mobile nylon bag technique and in vitro methods. Alternative methods developed for predicting the total tract and ileal digestibility of nutrients including amino acids in feedstuffs and diets for pigs have been reviewed. This article focuses on two in vitro methods that can be used for the routine evaluation of amino acid ileal digestibility and energy value of pig feeds and on factors affecting digestibility determined in vivo in pigs and by alternative methods. Validation of alternative methods has been carried out by comparing the results obtained using these methods with those acquired in vivo in pigs. In conclusion, energy and protein values of pig feeds may be estimated with satisfactory precision in rats and by the two- or three-step in vitro methods providing equations for the calculation of standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids and metabolizable energy content. The use of alternative methods of feed evaluation is an important way for reduction of stressful animal experiments.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMammalian spermatogenesis contains three continuous and organized processes, by which spermatogonia undergo mitosis and differentiate to spermatocytes, follow on meiosis to form haploid spermatids and ultimately transform into spermatozoa. These processes require an accurately, spatially and temporally regulated gene expression patterns. The microRNAs are a novel class of post-transcriptional regulators. Cumulating evidences have demonstrated that microRNAs are expressed in a cell-specific or stage-specific manner during spermatogenesis. In this review, we focus on the roles of microRNAs in spermatogenesis. We highlight that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is involved in the biogenesis of microRNAs and miRNA regulates the m6A modification on mRNA, and that specific miRNAs have been exploited as potential biomarkers for the male factor infertility, which will provide insightful understanding of microRNA roles in spermatogenesis.',\n",

The design allowed the calculation of NE values of corn, soybean meal and rapeseed meals according to the difference method. In Exp.2, 175 growing pigs (initial BW\\u2009=\\u200936.0\\u2009±\\u20095.2\\xa0kg) were fed 1 of 5 diets for 28 d, with five pigs per pen and seven replications (pens) per treatment in order to validate the measured energy values. Diets were a corn-soybean meal diet and four diets including 10% or 20% EP-RSM and 10% or 20% SE-RSM.ResultsThe NE of corn, soybean meal, EP-RSM and SE-RSM were 12.46, 11.34, 11.71 and 8.83\\xa0MJ/kg DM, respectively. The NE to ME ratio of corn (78%) was similar to tabular values, however, the NE to ME ratios of soybean meal (70%) and rapeseed meal (76%) were greater than tabular values. The greater NE value in EP-RSM than in SE-RSM is consistent with its higher EE content. Increasing EP-RSM or SE-RSM did not affect the growth performance of pigs and the caloric efficiency of NE was comparable for all diets.ConclusionsThe NE of EP-RSM was similar to soybean meal, and both were greater than SE-RSM. The DE, ME and NE values measured in Exp.1 are confirmed by results of Exp. 2 with comparable caloric efficiencies of DE, ME or NE for all diets.',\n",

In calves, several products have offered improved performance and health. Although several types of research have been completed, the mode of action of SCY is not clear in calves. Under this review, we have highlighted the works available in the literature on the use of SCY in calves performance, health, immunity, and the gut environment. Both active live yeast and yeast culture have positive effects on growth, rumen, small intestines, immunity and general health of the calf. Specifically, SCY can improve DMI, growth, feed efficiency and reduce diarrhea in calves. Furthermore, subtle improvements are seen in rumen fermentation (increased butyrate production) and rumen papillae growth. These positive results are, however, more pronounced in calves that are under stress or exposed to significant levels of disease-causing agents. There is a need for further research in areas such as gut morphology, gut microbiology and immunity using latest molecular methods to fully understand how SCY helps the growth and development of calves.',\n",

The supply of complexed trace minerals, which are more bioavailable, could help overcome the greater needs of these nutrients in tissues around parturition and early lactation.ResultsTwenty Holstein cows received an oral bolus with a mix of inorganic trace minerals (INO) or complexed trace minerals (AAC) to achieve 75, 65, 11, and 1 ppm supplemental Zn, Mn, Cu, and Co, respectively, in the total diet dry matter from -30 d through +30 d relative to parturition. Blood for polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) isolation was collected at -30, -15, +10, and + 30 d relative to parturition, whereas endometrium biopsies were performed at +14 and +30 d. Feeding AAC led to greater PMNL expression of genes related with inflammation response (DDX58), oxidative stress response (MPO), eicosanoid metabolism (PLA2G4A and ALOX5AP), transcription regulation (PPARG), and cellular adhesion (TLN1). The upregulation by AAC in endometrium of genes related with inflammation response (TLR2, TLR4, NFKB1, TNF, IL6, IL1B, IL10, IL8), prostaglandin synthesis (PTGS2, PTGES), and antioxidant responses (NFE2L2, SOD1) indicated a faster remodeling of uterine tissue and potentially greater capacity to control a local bacterial invasion.ConclusionsData indicate that trace mineral supplementation from amino acid complexes improves PMNL activity and allows the prompt recovery of uterine tissue during early lactation. As such, the benefits of complexed trace minerals extend beyond an improvement of liver function and productive performance.',\n",

However, there is little information on the effect of Bacillus spp. in combination with different dietary crude protein (CP) levels on the ileal digestibility and microbiota composition. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of Bacillus spp. supplementation to low- (LP) and high-protein diets (HP) on ileal CP and amino acid (AA) digestibility and intestinal microbiota composition.MethodsEight ileally cannulated pigs with an initial body weight of 28.5\\xa0kg were randomly allocated to a row-column design with 8 pigs and 3 periods of 16\\xa0d each. The assay diets were based on wheat-barley-soybean meal with two protein levels: LP (14% CP, as-fed) and HP diet (18% CP, as-fed). The LP and HP diets were supplemented with or without Bacillus spp. at a level of 0.04% (as-fed). The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA was determined. Bacterial community composition from ileal digesta was analyzed by Illumina amplicon sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR. Data were analyzed as a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial design using the GLIMMIX procedures of SAS.ResultsThe supplementation with Bacillus spp. did not affect both AID and SID of CP and AA in growing pigs. Moreover, there was no difference in AID of CP and AA between HP and LP diets, but SID of cystine, glutamic acid, glycine, and proline was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in pigs fed the HP diets. The HP diets increased abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp., (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and by amplicon sequencing the latter was identified as predominant genus in microbiota from HP with Bacillus spp., whereas dietary supplementation of Bacillus spp. increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) abundance of Roseburia spp..ConclusionsThe HP diet increased abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.. The supplementation of Bacillus spp. resulted in a higher abundance of healthy gut associated bacteria without affecting ileal CP and AA digestibility, whereas LP diet may reduce the flow of undigested protein to the large intestine of pigs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundA possible option to meet the increased demand of forage for dairy industry is to use the agricultural by-products, such as corn stover. However, nutritional value of crop residues is low and we have been seeking technologies to improve the value. A feeding trial was performed to evaluate the effects of four levels of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP; Original XP; Diamond V) on lactation performance and rumen fermentation in mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows fed a diet containing low-quality forage. Eighty dairy cows were randomly assigned into one of four treatments: basal diet supplemented with 0, 60, 120, or 180 g/d of SCFP per head mixed with 180, 120, 60, or 0 g of corn meal, respectively. The experiment lasted for 10 wks, with the first 2 weeks for adaptation.ResultsDry matter intake was found to be similar (P > 0.05) among the treatments. There was an increasing trend in milk production (linear, P ≤ 0.10) with the increasing level of SCFP supplementation, with no effects on contents of milk components (P > 0.05). Supplementation of SCFP linearly increased (P < 0.05) the N conversion, without affecting rumen pH and ammonia-N (P > 0.05). Increasing level of SCFP linearly increased (P < 0.05) concentrations of ruminal total volatile fatty acids, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, with no difference in molar proportion of individual acids (P > 0.05). The population of fungi and certain cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogenes) increased linearly (P < 0.05) but those of lactate-utilizing (Selenomonas ruminantium and Megasphaera elsdenii) and lactate-producing bacteria (Streptococcus bovis) decreased linearly (P ≤ 0.01) with increasing level of SCFP. The urinary purine derivatives increased linearly (P < 0.05) in response to SCFP supplementation, indicating that SCFP supplementation may benefit for microbial protein synthesis in the rumen.ConclusionsThe SCFP supplementation was effective in maintaining milk persistency of mid-lactation cows receiving diets containing low-quality forage. The beneficial effect of SCFP could be attributed to improved rumen function; 1) microbial population shift toward greater rumen fermentation efficiency indicated by higher rumen fungi and cellulolytic bacteria and lower lactate producing bacteria, and 2) rumen microbial fermentation toward greater supply of energy and protein indicated by greater ruminal VFA concentration and increased N conversion. Effects of SCFP were dose-depended and greater effects being observed with higher levels of supplementation and the effect was more noticeable during the high THI environment.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn this study the physiological implications of artificial rearing were investigated. Low (LBW) and normal birth weight (NBW) piglets were compared as they might react differently to stressors caused by artificial rearing. In total, 42 pairs of LBW and NBW piglets from 16 litters suckled the sow until d19 of age or were artificially reared starting at d3 until d19 of age. Blood and tissue samples that were collected after euthanasia at 0, 3, 5, 8 and 19\\xa0d of age. Histology, ELISA, and Ussing chamber analysis were used to study proximal and distal small intestine histo-morphology, proliferation, apoptosis, tight junction protein expression, and permeability. Furthermore, small intestine, liver and systemic redox parameters (GSH, GSSG, GSH-Px and MDA) were investigated using HPLC.ResultsLBW and NBW artificially reared piglets weighed respectively 40 and 33% more than LBW and NBW sow-reared piglets at d19 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Transferring piglets to a nursery at d3 resulted in villus atrophy, increased intestinal FD-4 and HRP permeability and elevated GSSG/GSH ratio in the distal small intestine at d5 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). GSH concentrations in the proximal small intestine remained stable, while they decreased in the liver (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). From d5 until d19, villus width and crypt depth increased, whereas PCNA, caspase-3, occludin and claudin-3 protein expressions were reduced. GSH, GSSG and permeability recovered in artificially reared piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionThe results suggest that artificial rearing altered the morphology, permeability and redox state without compromising piglet performance. The observed effects were not depending on birth weight.',\n",

The objective of the current study was to characterize the downstream regulation of the inflammatory response induced by Toll-like receptors in primary goat MEC (pgMEC). We performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) to measure mRNA levels of 9 genes involved in transcriptional regulation or antibacterial activity: Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB1), Toll interacting protein (TOLLIP), and lactoferrin (LTF). Furthermore, we analyzed 7 cytokines involved in Toll-like receptor signaling pathways: C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 6 (CXCL6), interleukin 8 (CXCL8), interleukin 1 beta  (IL1B), interleukin 6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF).ResultsStimulation of pgMEC with LPS for 3\\xa0h led to an increase in expression of CCL2, CXCL6, IL6, CXCL8, PTGS2, IFIT3, MYD88, NFKB1, and TLR4 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Except for IL6, and PTGS2, the same genes had greater expression than controls at 6\\xa0h post-LPS (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Expression of CCL5, PTGS2, IFIT3, NFKB1, TLR4, and TOLLIP was greater than controls after 3\\xa0h of incubation with LTA (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Compared to controls, stimulation with LTA for 6\\xa0h led to greater expression of PTGS2, IFIT3, NFKB1, and TOLLIP (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) whereas the expression of CXCL6, CXCL8, and TLR4 was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). At 3\\xa0h incubation with both toxins compared to controls a greater expression (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, IL6, PTGS2, IFIT3, IRF3, MYD88, and NFKB1 was detected. After 6\\xa0h of incubation with both toxins, the expression of CCL2, CXCL6, IFIT3, MYD88, NFKB1, and TLR4 was higher than the controls (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsData indicate that in the goat MEC, LTA induces a weaker inflammatory response than LPS. This may be related to the observation that gram-positive bacteria cause chronic mastitis more often than gram-negative infections.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundDietary saturated (SFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids can highly affect reproductive functions by providing additional energy, modulating the biochemical properties of tissues, and hormone secretions. In precocial mammals such as domestic guinea pigs the offspring is born highly developed. Gestation might be the most critical reproductive period in this species and dietary fatty acids may profoundly influence the gestational effort. We therefore determined the hormonal status at conception, the reproductive success, and body mass changes during gestation in guinea pigs maintained on diets high in PUFAs or SFAs, or a control diet.ResultsThe diets significantly affected the females’ plasma fatty acid status at conception, while cortisol and estrogen levels did not differ among groups. SFA females exhibited a significantly lower body mass and litter size, while the individual birth mass of pups did not differ among groups and a general higher pup mortality rate in larger litters was diminished by PUFAs and SFAs. The gestational effort, determined by a mother’s body mass gain during gestation, increased with total litter mass, whereas this increase was lowest in SFA and highest in PUFA individuals. The mother’s body mass after parturition did not differ among groups and was positively affected by the total litter mass in PUFA females.ConclusionsWhile SFAs reduce the litter size, but also the gestational effort as a consequence, PUFA supplementation may contribute to an adjustment of energy accumulations to the total litter mass, which may both favor a mother’s body condition at parturition and perhaps increase the offspring survival at birth.',\n",

Here, 53 maternal lineages of Small-tailed Han sheep were used to investigate the association of mitochondrial DNA variations and the lambing litter size.ResultsSequence sweeping of the mitochondrial coding regions discovered 31 non-synonymous mutations, and the association study revealed that T7719G in mtDNA tRNA-Lys gene was associated with litter size (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), manifesting 0.29 lambs per litter between the G and T carriers. Furthermore, using the mixed linear model, we assayed the potential association of the ovine litter size and haplogroups and multiple-level mtDNA haplotypes, including general haplotypes, assembled haplotypes of electron transport chain contained sequences (H-ETC), mitochondrial respiratory complex contained sequences (H-MRC) and mitochondrial genes (H-gene, including polypeptide-coding genes, rRNA genes and tRNA genes). The strategy for assembled mitochondrial haplotypes was proposed for the first time in mtDNA association analyses on economic traits, although none of the significant relations could be concluded (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). In addition, the nuclear major gene BMPR1B was significantly correlated with litter size in the flock (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), however, did not interact with mtDNA T7719G mutation (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05).ConclusionsOur results highlight mutations of ovine mitochondrial coding genes, suggesting T7719G in tRNA-Lys gene be a potentially useful marker for selection of sheep litter size.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIndigestible markers are commonly utilized in digestion studies, but the complete disappearance or maximum appearance of a marker in feces can be affected by diet composition, feed intake, or an animal’s BW. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of previous (Phase 1, P1) and current- (Phase 2, P2) diet composition on marker disappearance (Cr) and appearance (Ti) in pigs fed 3 diets differing in NDF content.ResultsWhen pigs were maintained on the 25.1, 72.5, and 125.0\\xa0g/kg NDF diets, it took 5.1, 4.1, and 2.5 d, respectively, for Cr levels to decrease below the limit of quantitation; or 4.6, 3.7, or 2.8 d, respectively, for Ti to be maximized. These effects were not, however, independent of the previous diet as indicated by the interaction between P1 and P2 diets on fecal marker concentrations (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). When dietary NDF increased from P1 to P2, it took less time for fecal Cr to decrease or fecal Ti to be maximized (an average of 2.5 d), than if NDF decreased from P1 to P2 where it took longer for fecal Cr to decrease or fecal Ti to be maximized (an average of 3.4 d).ConclusionsBecause of the wide range in excretion times reported in the literature and improved laboratory methods for elemental detection, the data suggests that caution must be taken in considering dietary fiber concentrations of the past and currently fed diets so that no previous dietary marker addition remains in the digestive tract or feces such that a small amount of maker is present to confound subsequent experimental results, and that marker concentration have stabilized when these samples are collected.',\n",

The specific surface areas, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the modified Mt were investigated.ResultsIn the modified Mt, hydrated Cu ions and Zn ions were exchanged in the interlayer space of Mt and the particles were irregular shapes. The results showed that Cu/Zn-Mt enhanced antibacterial and antifungal activity compared with Zn-Mt and Cu-Mt possibly due to the synergistic effect between Cu and Zn. Among the Cu/Zn-Mt with different Cu/Zn raitos, Cu/Zn-Mt with a Cu/Zn ratio of 0.98 or 0.51 showed higher antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), fungi (Candida albicans). Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of Cu/Zn-Mt was correlated with its specific surface area. Cytotoxicity studies on IPEC-J2 cell showed a slight cytotoxicity of Cu/Zn-Mt.ConclusionsThe current data provide clear evidence that in terms of its antimicrobial activity and relatively low toxicity, the Cu/Zn-Mt holds great promise for applications in animal husbandry.',\n",

Recently, production demands on the livestock industry have been centered around the use of antibiotics as growth promoters due to growing concern over microbial antibiotic resistance. With many countries reporting increased incidences of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, laws and regulations are being updated to end in-feed antibiotic use in the animal production industry. This sets the need for suitable alternatives to be established for inclusion in feed. Many reports have shown evidence that nanoparticles may be good candidates for animal growth promotion and antimicrobials. The current status and advancements of nanotechnological applications in animal production will be the focus of this review and the emerging roles of nanoparticles for nutrient delivery, biocidal agents, and tools in veterinary medicine and reproduction will be discussed. Additionally, influences on meat, egg, and milk quality will be reviewed.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractRecent years have witnessed growing interest in the role of peptides in animal nutrition. Chemical, enzymatic, or microbial hydrolysis of proteins in animal by-products or plant-source feedstuffs before feeding is an attractive means of generating high-quality small or large peptides that have both nutritional and physiological or regulatory functions in livestock, poultry and fish. These peptides may also be formed from ingested proteins in the gastrointestinal tract, but the types of resultant peptides can vary greatly with the physiological conditions of the animals and the composition of the diets. In the small intestine, large peptides are hydrolyzed to small peptides, which are absorbed into enterocytes faster than free amino acids (AAs) to provide a more balanced pattern of AAs in the blood circulation. Some peptides of plant or animal sources also have antimicrobial, antioxidant, antihypertensive, and immunomodulatory activities. Those peptides which confer biological functions beyond their nutritional value are called bioactive peptides. They are usually 2–20 AA residues in length but may consist of >20 AA residues. Inclusion of some (e.g. 2–8%) animal-protein hydrolysates (e.g., porcine intestine, porcine mucosa, salmon viscera, or poultry tissue hydrolysates) or soybean protein hydrolysates in practical corn- and soybean meal-based diets can ensure desirable rates of growth performance and feed efficiency in weanling pigs, young calves, post-hatching poultry, and fish. Thus, protein hydrolysates hold promise in optimizing the nutrition of domestic and companion animals, as well as their health (particularly gut health) and well-being.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundSperm DNA fragmentation (sDF) has been proved to be an important parameter in order to predict in vitro the potential fertility of a semen sample. Colloid centrifugation could be a suitable technique to select those donkey sperm more resistant to DNA fragmentation after thawing. Previous studies have shown that to elucidate the latent damage of the DNA molecule, sDF should be assessed dynamically, where the rate of fragmentation between treatments indicates how resistant the DNA is to iatrogenic damage. The rate of fragmentation is calculated using the slope of a linear regression equation. However, it has not been studied if sDF dynamics fit this model. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of different after-thawing centrifugation protocols on sperm DNA fragmentation and elucidate the most accurate mathematical model (linear regression, exponential or polynomial) for DNA fragmentation over time in frozen-thawed donkey semen.ResultsAfter submitting post-thaw semen samples to no centrifugation (UDC), sperm washing (SW) or single layer centrifugation (SLC) protocols, sDF values after 6\\xa0h of incubation were significantly lower in SLC samples than in SW or UDC. Coefficient of determination (R2) values were significantly higher for a second order polynomial model than for linear or exponential. The highest values for acceleration of fragmentation (aSDF) were obtained for SW, followed by SLC and UDC.ConclusionSLC after thawing seems to preserve longer DNA longevity in comparison to UDC and SW. Moreover, the fine-tuning of models has shown that sDF dynamics in frozen-thawed donkey semen fit a second order polynomial model, which implies that fragmentation rate is not constant and fragmentation acceleration must be taken into account to elucidate hidden damage in the DNA molecule.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe purpose of this study was to determine the association of three proteins involved in sperm function on the freezability of porcine semen: the heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90a), the Niemann-Pick disease type C2 protein (NPC2), and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS).Six adult boars (each boar was ejaculated three times, 18 in total) were classified by freezability based on the percentage of functionally competent sperm. The male semen with highest freezability (MHF) and the male semen with lowest freezability (MLF) were centrifuged immediately after collection to separate seminal plasma and spermatozoa to make four possible combinations of these two components and to incubate them for 3\\xa0h, adjusting the temperature to 17\\xa0°C, to freeze them afterwards. The quantification of proteins was performed in two stages: at zero and at 3\\xa0h after incubation of the four combinations.ResultsThe spermatozoa × incubation time (IT) interaction only had effect (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) on HSP90a levels; this protein increased in seminal plasma, after 3\\xa0h of incubation, in larger quantity (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in combinations with MLF spermatozoa. In relation with the NPC2 protein, two isoforms of 16 and 19\\xa0kDa were identified. The 19\\xa0kDa isoform was affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) only by the seminal plasma × IT interaction, with superior values (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) both at zero and three hours of incubation, in the combinations with MHF seminal plasma; and 16\\xa0kDa isoform was affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) only by the IT with reduction after 3\\xa0h of incubation. The levels of L-PGDS was affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) only by the spermatozoa × IT interaction, which reduced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) in combinations with MLF spermatozoa after 3\\xa0h of incubation.ConclusionsIt is possible to consider that the three proteins evaluated were associated with freezability of boar semen due, especially, to the fact that mixtures with MLF spermatozoa showed greater increase levels of the HSP90a protein and reduction of L-PGDS in plasma. In addition, the seminal plasma of MHF had higher concentration of the NPC2 of 19\\xa0kDa protein, which was reduced by incubating with MHF spermatozoa.',\n",

In many parts of the world growing seasons are short, and the grain crops that can be grown may not provide adequate yields. Sugar beets, on the other hand are relatively hardy, and dry matter yields surpass the yields of most grain crops. There are however, perceptions that beets may not be suitable as a feed ingredient due to the fact that the storage form of carbohydrate is sugar rather than starch. With little analytical support, sugar has been rejected in many feeding programs with the view that sugar reduces rumen pH, fiber digestion and microbial yield. This review explores available facts revolving around these concerns. Information regarding the feeding of sugar beets is provided and the use of sugar beets as a partial replacement for grain is proposed.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe health of chickens and the welfare of poultry industry are central to the efforts of addressing global food security. Therefore, it is essential to study chicken immunology to maintain and improve its health and to find novel and sustainable solutions. This paper presents a study on investigation of the effect of Scutellaria baicalensis root (SBR) on the immune response of broiler chicken, especially on lymphocytes and heterophils reactivity, regarding their contribution to the development of immunity of the chickens.MethodsThe 121-day-old Hubbard Hi-Y male broiler hybrids were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, three SBR supplemented groups (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of SBR) and one control group. Each treatment was replicated five times with six birds per replicate pen in a battery brooder. Blood was collected after 3rd and 6th wk of the experiment, and hemoglobin and hematocrit values were determined, as well as total leukocyte count and differential count were performed. Nitroblue tetrazolium test and phagocytosis assay as nonspecific immune parameters and humoral immune responses to the antigenic challenge by sheep red blood cells were performed. Moreover, the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes to form radial segmentation (RS) of their nuclei was analyzed. Body weight and relative weight of spleen, liver, and bursa of Fabricius were recorded.ResultsResults showed that mean heterophile/lymphocyte ratio increased in the SBR groups compared to the control group and the blood of the chickens showed lymphocytic depletion. The results also demonstrated that the relative weight of bursa of Fabricius and spleen in groups fed with SBR significantly decreased compared to the control group. This study also showed that the addition of SBR significantly inhibited the formation of RS of nuclei compared to some cytotoxic substances.ConclusionWe found that SBR supplementation should be carefully evaluated when given to poultry. The excess intake of SBR supplementation may cause immunologic inhibition and may negatively affect the development of immune organs. SBR has inhibited the formation of radial segmentation nuclei showing antimetastatic properties and also the phagocytosis of chicken heterophils.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundG-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), also referred as Free Fatty Acid Receptors (FFAR), are widely studied within human medicine as drug targets for metabolic disorders. To combat metabolic disorders prevalent in dairy cows during the transition period, which co-occur with negative energy balance and changes to lipid and glucose metabolism, it may be helpful to identify locations and roles of FFAR and other members of the GPCR family in bovine tissues.ResultsQuantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) of subcutaneous adipose, liver, and PMNL samples during the transition period (-10, +7, and +20 or +30 d) were used for expression profiling of medium- (MCFA) and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) receptors GPR120 and GPR40, MCFA receptor GPR84, and niacin receptor HCAR2/3. Adipose samples were obtained from cows with either high (HI; BCS\\u2009≥\\u20093.75) or low (LO; BCS\\u2009≤\\u20093.25) body condition score (BCS) to examine whether FFAR expression is correlated with this indicator of health and body reserves. Supplementation of rumen-protected methionine (MET), which may improve immune function and production postpartum, was also compared with unsupplemented control (CON) cows for liver and blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) samples. In adipose tissue, GPR84 and GPR120 were differentially expressed over time, while GPR40 was not expressed; in PMNL, GPR40 was differentially expressed over time and between MET vs. CON, GPR84 expression differed only between dietary groups, and GPR120 was not expressed; in liver, GPCR were either not expressed or barely detectable.ConclusionsThe data indicate that there is likely not a direct role in liver for the selected GPCR during the transition period, but they do play variable roles in adipose and PMN. In future, these receptors may prove useful targets and/or markers for peripartal metabolism and immunity.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundDuring sperm maturation, there is a reorganization of fatty acids from plasmatic membrane of the spermatozoa, which allows higher membrane integrity and acquisition of sperm motility. However, the fatty acid profile during sperm maturation remains unclear in dogs. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the fatty acids from the epididymal spermatozoa and plasma during the sperm maturation, and observed changes in the motility and plasmatic membrane parameters. Twenty one adult dogs were used, subsequently to bilateral orchiectomy and epididymal storage, sperm samples were collected from the different segments of the epididymis. Samples were evaluated for conventional microscopy, computer-assisted motility analysis, sperm plasma membrane permeability and the fatty acid analysis (lipids were extracted, transmethylated and analyzed by chromatography).ResultsCaput and corpus sperm showed lower values for the motility variables evaluated and plasmatic membrane integrity, indicating different levels of the fatty acids organization. Saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids were in higher concentrations in the spermatozoa from epididymis cauda. Highlighting the presence of caprylic, stearic and docosahexaenoic acids.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the influence of the fatty acid profile during sperm maturation, assigning physical and chemical changes in sperm cells, essential for fertilization.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundFeeding higher-energy prepartum is a common practice in the dairy industry. However, recent data underscore how it could reduce performance, deepen negative energy balance, and augment inflammation and oxidative stress in fresh cows. We tested the effectiveness of rumen-protected methionine in preventing the negative effect of feeding a higher-energy prepartum. Multiparous Holstein cows were fed a control lower-energy diet (CON, 1.24 Mcal/kg DM; high-straw) during the whole dry period (~50 d), or were switched to a higher-energy (OVE, 1.54 Mcal/kg DM), or OVE plus Smartamine M (OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM; Adisseo NA) during the last 21 d before calving. Afterwards cows received the same lactation diet (1.75 Mcal/kg DM). Smartamine M was top-dressed on the OVE diet (0.07% of DM) from -21 through 30 d in milk (DIM). Liver samples were obtained via percutaneous biopsy at -10, 7 and 21 DIM. Expression of genes associated with energy and lipid metabolism, hepatokines, methionine cycle, antioxidant capacity and inflammation was measured.ResultsPostpartal dry matter intake, milk yield, and energy-corrected milk were higher in CON and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with OVE. Furthermore, milk protein and fat percentages were greater in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with CON and OVE. Expression of the gluconeogenic gene PCK1 and the lipid-metabolism transcription regulator PPARA was again greater with CON and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with OVE. Expression of the lipoprotein synthesis enzyme MTTP was lower in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM than CON or OVE. Similarly, the hepatokine FGF21, which correlates with severity of negative energy balance, was increased postpartum only in OVE compared to the other two groups. These results indicate greater liver metabolism and functions to support a greater production in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM. At 7 DIM, the enzyme GSR involved in the synthesis of glutathione tended to be upregulated in OVE than CON-fed cows, suggesting a greater antioxidant demand in overfed cows. Feeding OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM resulted in lower similar expression of GSR compared with CON. Expression of the methionine cycle enzymes SAHH and MTR, both of which help synthesize methionine endogenously, was greater prepartum in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with both CON and OVE, and at 7 DIM for CON and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with OVE, suggesting greater Met availability. It is noteworthy that DNMT3A, which utilizes S-adenosylmethionine generated in the methionine cycle, was greater in OVE and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM indicating higher-energy diets might enhance DNA methylation, thus, Met utilization.ConclusionsData indicate that supplemental Smartamine M was able to compensate for the negative effect of prepartal energy-overfeeding by alleviating the demand for intracellular antioxidants, thus, contributing to the increase in production. Moreover Smartamine M improved hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism, leading to greater liver function and better overall health.',\n",

However, bacterial profiles in rumen original digesta, liquid and solid fractions vary from each other and need to be better established.MethodsTo compare bacterial profiles in each fraction, samples of rumen digesta from six cows fed either a high fiber diet (HFD) or a high energy diet (HED) were collected via rumen fistulas. Rumen digesta was then squeezed through four layers of cheesecloth to separate liquid and solid fractions. The bacterial profiles of rumen original digesta, liquid and solid fractions were analyzed with High-throughput sequencing technique.ResultsRumen bacterial diversity was mainly affected by diet and individual cow (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) rather than rumen fraction. Bias distributed bacteria were observed in solid and liquid fractions of rumen content using Venn diagram and LEfSe analysis. Fifteen out of 16 detected biomarkers (using LEfSe analysis) were found in liquid fraction, and these 15 biomarkers contributed the most to the bacterial differences among rumen content fractions.ConclusionsSimilar results were found when using samples of original rumen digesta, rumen liquid or solid fractions to assess diversity of rumen bacteria; however, more attention should be draw onto bias distributed bacteria in different ruminal fractions, especially when liquid fraction has been used as a representative sample for rumen bacterial study.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn the last years, difficulties occurring in corn cultivation (i.e., groundwater shortages, mycotoxin contamination) have been forcing dairy farmers to consider alternative silages. Some experiments conducted on lactating cows have proven that the total replacement of corn silage with sorghum silage did not reduce milk yield. However, this kind of substitution involves supplementing sorghum-based diets with grains, to compensate for the lower starch content of sorghum silage compared to corn silage. Change of silage type and inclusion of starch sources in the diet would influence rumen fermentations, with possible effects on milk composition (i.e., fatty acid profile) and coagulation properties. A worsening of milk coagulation properties would have a negative economic impact in Italy, where most of the milk produced is processed into cheese.This study was designed to compare milk composition and quality, with emphasis on fatty acid profile and coagulation properties, in dairy cows fed two diets based on corn or sorghum silage.ResultsThe sorghum diet reduced milk yield (P\\u2009=\\u20090.043) but not 4% fat corrected milk (P\\u2009=\\u20090.85). Feeding sorghum silage did not influence milk contents of protein (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07) and lactose (P\\u2009=\\u20090.65), and increased fat content (P\\u2009=\\u20090.024). No differences emerged for milk concentrations of saturated (P\\u2009=\\u20090.61) and monounsaturated fatty acids (P\\u2009=\\u20090.50), whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) for the sorghum diet. Concentrations of n-6 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and n-3 fatty acids (P\\u2009=\\u20090.017) were lower in milk of cows fed the sorghum diet. Milk coagulation properties did not differ between the two diets, except the “a30” (the curd firmness, expressed in mm, 30 min after rennet addition), that was lower (P\\u2009=\\u20090.042) for the sorghum diet.ConclusionsFeeding a forage sorghum silage, properly supplemented with corn meal, as total replacement of corn silage maintained milk composition and did not influence negatively milk coagulation properties, which have a great economic relevance for the Italian dairy industry. Thus, silages obtained from forage sorghums could have a potential as substitute of corn silages in dairy cow diets.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn this experiment, intermittent suckling (IS) with or without the co-mingling (CoM) of piglets was studied as a method to stimulate solid feed intake and reduce post-weaning stress.MethodsThree weaning regimes using 30 multiparous sows were compared: (1) conventional weaning (CW) (n\\u2009=\\u200910 litters), where piglets had continuous access to the sow until weaning (d 0, farrowing\\u2009=\\u2009d −25 relative to weaning); (2) intermittent suckling (IS) (n\\u2009=\\u200910 litters), where piglets were separated from the sow for 8\\xa0h/d starting at d −7 (relative to weaning); and (3) intermittent suckling with co-mingling (ISCo) (n\\u2009=\\u200910 litters) where IS started at d −7 and two litters were housed together during separation and then returned to their original sow. Ad libitum creep feed was available from d −17. At weaning pigs were housed in pens of 11 pigs, 27 pens in total. The ISCo treatment was divided in half to examine effects of different mixing strategies after weaning. Half of the ISCo litters were kept in familiar groups (ISCoF, familiar, n\\u2009=\\u20094) and the other half were mixed within treatment resulting in groups of unfamiliar pigs (ISCoNF, not familiar,\\xa0n\\xa0= 5), the same as IS (n\\u2009=\\u20099) and CW (n\\u2009=\\u20099) treatments.ResultsThe ISCo piglets ate more creep feed in the week before weaning (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), but also showed more aggressive and manipulative behaviour on first day of CoM compared with CW piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). IS with or without CoM increased exploratory and play behaviour on the first day of treatment intervention (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and increased sleeping behaviour on the last day of treatment intervention compared with CW (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mixing strategy at weaning had an effect on performance data with the highest growth and feed intake seen in ISCoF pigs 2 to 8\\xa0d after weaning (P <0.001). IS and ISCoNF pigs also grew faster and ate more than CW pigs 2 to 8 d after weaning (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Post-weaning injury scores suggested reduced aggression in ISCo as evidenced by reduced redness (skin irritation) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and a tendency for ISCo to have less scratches than CW (P\\u2009<\\u20090.1). The IS pigs slept the most and displayed less manipulative behaviours on the day of weaning and plasma haptoglobin levels remained low in IS pigs after weaning (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.01).ConclusionsBoth intermittent suckling techniques improved production indices in the immediate post-weaning period. However, the addition of co-mingling before weaning in combination with grouping familiar pigs together after weaning improved performance in an additive manner.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMethanogenic archaea reside primarily in the rumen and the lower segments of the intestines of ruminants, where they utilize the reducing equivalents derived from rumen fermentation to reduce carbon dioxide, formic acid, or methylamines to methane (CH4). Research on methanogens in the rumen has attracted great interest in the last decade because CH4 emission from ruminants contributes to global greenhouse gas emission and represents a loss of feed energy. Some DNA-based phylogenetic studies have depicted a diverse and dynamic community of methanogens in the rumen. In the past decade, researchers have focused on elucidating the underpinning that determines and affects the diversity, composition, structure, and dynamics of methanogen community of the rumen. Concurrently, many researchers have attempted to develop and evaluate interventions to mitigate enteric CH4 emission. Although much work has been done using plant secondary metabolites, other approaches such as using nitrate and 3-nitrooxy propanol have also yielded promising results. Most of these antimethanogenic compounds or substances often show inconsistent results among studies and also lead to adverse effects on feed intake and digestion and other aspects of rumen fermentation when fed at doses high enough to achieve effective mitigation. This review provides a brief overview of the rumen methanogens and then an appraisal of most of the antimethanogenic compounds and substances that have been evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Knowledge gaps and future research needs are also discussed with a focus on methanogens and methane mitigation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractAt birth the piglet’s immune system is immature and it is dependent upon passive maternal protection until weaning. The piglet’s mucosal immune system develops over the first few weeks but has not reached maturity at weaning ages which are common on commercial farms. At weaning piglets are presented with a vast and diverse range of microbial and dietary/environmental antigens. Their ability to distinguish between antigens and mount a protective response to potential pathogens and to develop tolerance to dietary antigens is critical to their survival and failure to do so is reflected in the high incidence of morbidity and mortality in the post-weaning period. A growing recognition that the widespread use of antibiotics to control infection during this critical period should be controlled has led to detailed studies of those factors which drive the development of the mucosal immune system, the role of gut microbiota in driving this process, the origin of the bacteria that colonise the young piglet’s intestine and the impact of rearing environment. This review briefly describes how the mucosal immune system is equipped to respond “appropriately” to antigenic challenge and the programmed sequence by which it develops. The results of studies on the critical interplay between the host immune system and gut microbiota are discussed along with the effects of rearing environment. By comparing these with results from human studies on the development of allergies in children, an approach to promote an earlier maturation of the piglet immune system to resist the challenges of weaning are outlined.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundAdaptive response includes a variety of physiological modifications to face changes in external or internal conditions and adapt to a new situation. The acute phase proteins (APPs) are reactants synthesized against environmental stimuli like stress, infection, inflammation.MethodsTo delineate the differences in molecular constituents of adaptive response to the environment we performed the whole-blood transcriptome analysis in Italian Holstein (IH) and Italian Simmental (IS) breeds. For this, 663 IH and IS cows from six commercial farms were clustered according to the blood level of APPs. Ten extreme individuals (five APP+ and APP- variants) from each farm were selected for the RNA-seq using the Illumina sequencing technology. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were analyzed using dynamic impact approach (DIA) and DAVID annotation clustering. Milk production data were statistically elaborated to assess the association of APP+ and APP- gene expression patterns with variations in milk parameters.ResultsThe overall de novo assembly of cDNA sequence data generated 13,665 genes expressed in bovine blood cells. Comparative genomic analysis revealed 1,152 DE genes in the comparison of all APP+ vs. all APP- variants; 531 and 217 DE genes specific for IH and IS comparison respectively. In all comparisons overexpressed genes were more represented than underexpressed ones. DAVID analysis revealed 369 DE genes across breeds, 173 and 73 DE genes in IH and IS comparison respectively. Among the most impacted pathways for both breeds were vitamin B6 metabolism, folate biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism.ConclusionsBoth DIA and DAVID approaches produced a high number of significantly impacted genes and pathways with a narrow connection to adaptive response in cows with high level of blood APPs. A similar variation in gene expression and impacted pathways between APP+ and APP- variants was found between two studied breeds. Such similarity was also confirmed by annotation clustering of the DE genes. However, IH breed showed higher and more differentiated impacts compared to IS breed and such particular features in the IH adaptive response could be explained by its higher metabolic activity. Variations of milk production data were significantly associated with APP+ and APP- gene expression patterns.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIt is widely known that branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are not only elementary components for building muscle tissue but also participate in increasing protein synthesis in animals and humans. BCAA (isoleucine, leucine and valine) regulate many key signaling pathways, the most classic of which is the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. This signaling pathway connects many diverse physiological and metabolic roles. Recent years have witnessed many striking developments in determining the novel functions of BCAA including: (1) Insufficient or excessive levels of BCAA in the diet enhances lipolysis. (2) BCAA, especially isoleucine, play a major role in enhancing glucose consumption and utilization by up-regulating intestinal and muscular glucose transporters. (3) Supplementation of leucine in the diet enhances meat quality in finishing pigs. (4) BCAA are beneficial for mammary health, milk quality and embryo growth. (5) BCAA enhance intestinal development, intestinal amino acid transportation and mucin production. (6) BCAA participate in up-regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, abnormally elevated BCAA levels in the blood (decreased BCAA catabolism) are a good biomarker for the early detection of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases. This review will provide some insights into these novel metabolic and physiological functions of BCAA.',\n",

Inclusion levels of CCDS and CWS for Treatments 1, 2, and 3 were fixed during all the three phases of the experiment. Inclusion levels of CWS and CCDS were on 88% dry matter basis. The liquid feeding system delivered feed from the mixing tank to feed troughs by high-pressure air, had sensors inside feed troughs, and recorded daily feed intake on the basis of a reference feed intake curve. The pigs were fed 5 to 10 times per day with increasing frequency during the experiment.ResultsControl pigs had greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) average daily gain (0.91 vs. 0.84, 0.85, 0.85\\xa0kg/d) and gain to feed ratio (0.37 vs. 0.33, 0.34, 0.34) than pigs in the other three treatments during the overall period. Compared with the control, the other three groups had (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) or tended to have (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) lower carcass weight and backfat depth due to lighter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) slaughter body weight, but similar (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) dressing percentage, loin muscle depth, and lean percentage were observed among the four treatments. Inclusion of CWS and CCDS reduced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) or tended to reduce (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) belly firmness but did not influence (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) the overall like, flavor, tenderness and juiciness of loin chops when compared with the control group.ConclusionIn conclusion, our results indicate that including 30–50% of a mixture of whole stillage and condensed distiller’s solubles in the growing-finishing diets may reduce growth performance, carcass weight and belly firmness, but does not affect pork sensory traits.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMethane emissions from ruminant livestock contribute significantly to the large environmental footprint of agriculture. The rumen is the principal source of methane, and certain features of the microbiome are associated with low/high methane phenotypes. Despite their primary role in methanogenesis, the abundance of archaea has only a weak correlation with methane emissions from individual animals. The composition of the archaeal community appears to have a stronger effect, with animals harbouring the Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii clade tending to be associated with greater methane emissions. Ciliate protozoa produce abundant H2, the main substrate for methanogenesis in the rumen, and their removal (defaunation) results in an average 11% lower methane emissions in vivo, but the results are not consistent. Different protozoal genera seem to result in greater methane emissions, though community types (A, AB, B and O) did not differ. Within the bacteria, three different ‘ruminotypes’ have been identified, two of which predispose animals to have lower methane emissions. The two low-methane ruminotypes are generally characterized by less abundant H2-producing bacteria. A lower abundance of Proteobacteria and differences in certain Bacteroidetes and anaerobic fungi seem to be associated with high methane emissions. Rumen anaerobic fungi produce abundant H2 and formate, and their abundance generally corresponds to the level of methane emissions. Thus, microbiome analysis is consistent with known pathways for H2 production and methanogenesis, but not yet in a predictive manner. The production and utilisation of formate by the ruminal microbiota is poorly understood and may be a source of variability between animals.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundPrimordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of functional gametes, have distinct characteristics and exhibit several unique molecular mechanisms to maintain pluripotency and germness in comparison to somatic cells. They express germ cell-specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs) by modulating tissue-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements. Studies on gene structures of chicken vasa homologue (CVH), a chicken RNA binding protein, involved in temporal and spatial regulation are thus important not only for understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate germ cell fate, but also for practical applications of primordial germ cells. However, very limited studies are available on regulatory elements that control germ cell-specific expression in chicken. Therefore, we investigated the intricate regulatory mechanism(s) that governs transcriptional control of CVH.ResultsWe constructed green fluorescence protein (GFP) or luciferase reporter vectors containing the various 5′ flanking regions of CVH gene. From the 5′ deletion and fragmented assays in chicken PGCs, we have identified a CVH promoter that locates at −316 to +275 base pair fragment with the highest luciferase activity. Additionally, we confirmed for the first time that the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) containing intron 1 is required for promoter activity of the CVH gene in chicken PGCs. Furthermore, using a transcription factor binding prediction, transcriptome analysis and siRNA-mediated knockdown, we have identified that a set of transcription factors play a role in the PGC-specific CVH gene expression.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that cis-elements and transcription factors localizing in the 5′ flanking region including the 5′ UTR and an intron are important for transcriptional regulation of the CVH gene in chicken PGCs. Finally, this information will contribute to research studies in areas of reproductive biology, constructing of germ cell-specific synthetic promoter for tracing primordial germ cells as well as understanding the transcriptional regulation for maintaining germness in PGCs.',\n",

Mean values for contents of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in grain legumes ranged from 111 and 79\\xa0g/kg DM in peas to 248 and 207\\xa0g/kg DM in lupins, respectively. Contents of condensed tannins in the colored flowered faba bean cultivars ranged from 2.1 to 7.4\\xa0g/kg DM. The AID of starch was greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in pea than in faba bean cultivars, and using the polarimetric starch determination method resulted in greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) digestibility values than using enzymatic starch analysis (84 vs. 80% in faba beans and 86 vs. 83% in peas). Moreover, AID of starch differed (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) within pea cultivars and starch digestibility in faba beans decreased linearly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) as the content of condensed tannins increased. However, there was no relationship between contents of NDF and ADF and AID of starch in pea and faba bean cultivars.ConclusionBoth contents and AID of starch in grain legumes can vary as influenced by the analytical method used for starch determination. Generally, starch digestibility is greater when measured by polarimetric rather than enzymatic methods.',\n",

Apart from milk somatic cell count (SCC) and somatic cell score (SCS), serum cytokines such as interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) may also be potential indicators for bovine mastitis. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in bovine IL-17F and IL-17A genes on SCC, SCS and serum cytokines in Chinese Holstein and Inner-Mongolia Sanhe cattle, and to compare the mRNA expression variations of the cows with different genotypes.ResultsA total of 464 lactating cows (337 Holstein and 127 Inner-Mongolia Sanhe cattle) were screened for SNPs identification and the data were analyzed using fixed effects of herd, parity, season and year of calving by general linear model procedure.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundMastitis, an infection caused by Gram-positive bacteria, produces udder inflammation and oxidative injury in milk-producing mammals. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is important for host recognition of invading Gram-positive microbes. Over-expression of TLR2 in transgenic dairy goats is a useful model for studying various aspects of infection with Gram-positive bacteria, in vivo.MethodsWe over-expressed TLR2 in transgenic dairy goats. Pam3CSK4, a component of Gram-positive bacteria, triggered the TLR2 signal pathway by stimulating the monocytes-macrophages from the TLR2-positive transgenic goats, and induced over-expression of activator protein-1 (AP-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inflammation factors downstream of the signal pathway.ResultsCompared with wild-type controls, measurements of various oxidative stress-related molecules showed that TLR2, when over-expressed in transgenic goat monocytes-macrophages, resulted in weak lipid damage, high level expression of anti-oxidative stress proteins, and significantly increased mRNA levels of transcription factor NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and the downstream gene, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). When Pam3CSK4 was used to stimulate ear tissue in vivo the HO-1 protein of the transgenic goats had a relatively high expression level.ConclusionsThe results indicate that the oxidative injury in goats over-expressing TLR2 was reduced following Pam3CSK4 stimulation. The underlying mechanism for this reduction was increased expression of the anti-oxidation gene HO-1 by activation of the Nrf2 signal pathway.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of supplementing lactating sows with HMB on skeletal muscle fiber type transformation and growth of the offspring during d 28 and 180 after birth. A total of 20 sows according to their body weight were divided into the control (CON, n\\u2009=\\u200910) or HMB groups (HMB, n\\u2009=\\u200910). Sows in the HMB group were supplemented with β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate calcium (HMB-Ca) 2\\xa0g /kg feed during d 1 to 27 of lactation. After weaning, 48 mixed sex piglets were blocked by sow treatment and fed standard diets for post-weaning, growing, finishing periods. Growth performance was recorded during d 28 to 180 after birth. Pigs were slaughtered on d 28 (n\\u2009=\\u20096/treatment) and 180 (n\\u2009=\\u20096/treatment) postnatal, and the longissimus dorsi (LD) was collected, respectively.ResultsThe HMB-fed sows during lactation showed increased HMB concentration (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in milk and LD of weaning piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, offsprings in HMB group had a higher finishing BW and lean percentage than did pigs in CON group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), meanwhile, compared with pigs from sows fed the CON diet, pigs from sows fed HMB diet showed higher type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), elevated myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIb and Sox6 mRNA, and fast-MyHC protein levels in LD (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).Conclusion sHMB supplemented to sow diets throughout lactation increases the levels of HMB in maternal milk and skeletal muscle of pigs during d 28 after birth and promotes subsequent performance of pigs between d 28 and 180 of age by enhancing glycolytic muscle fiber transformation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe chicken gastrointestinal tract contains a diverse microbiota whose composition and structure play important roles in gut functionality. In this study, microbial shifts resulting from feed supplementation with Bacillus subtilis CSL2 were evaluated in broilers challenged and unchallenged with Salmonella Gallinarum. To analyse bacterial community composition and functionality, 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed.ResultsThe Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline was used to analyse changes in the faecal microbiota over a 24-h period. A total of 718,204 sequences from broiler chickens were recorded and analysed. At the phylum level, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant bacterial taxa. In Salmonella-infected chickens (SC), Bacteroidetes were more highly abundant compared to control (NC) and Bacillus-treated (BT) chickens. At the genus level, in the NC and BT groups, Lactobacillus was present at high abundance, and the abundance of Turicibacter, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, and Bacteroides increased in SC broilers. Furthermore, taxon-independent analysis showed that the SC and BT groups were compositionally distinct at the end of the 24-h period. Further analysis of functional properties showed that B. subtilis CSL2 administration increased gut-associated energy supply mechanisms (i.e. carbohydrate transport and metabolism) to maintain a stable microbiota and protect gut integrity.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that S. Gallinarum infection and B. subtilis CSL2 supplementation in the diet of broiler chickens influenced the diversity, composition, and functional diversity of the faecal microbiota. Moreover, the findings offer significant insights to understand potential mechanisms of Salmonella infection and the mode of action of probiotics in broiler chickens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIn the last five decades, attempts have been made to improve rumen fermentation and host animal nutrition through modulation of rumen microbiota. The goals have been decreasing methane production, partially inhibiting protein degradation to avoid excess release of ammonia, and activation of fiber digestion. The main approach has been the use of dietary supplements. Since growth-promoting antibiotics were banned in European countries in 2006, safer alternatives including plant-derived materials have been explored. Plant oils, their component fatty acids, plant secondary metabolites and other compounds have been studied, and many originate or are abundantly available in Asia as agricultural byproducts. In this review, the potency of selected byproducts in inhibition of methane production and protein degradation, and in stimulation of fiber degradation was described in relation to their modes of action. In particular, cashew and ginkgo byproducts containing alkylphenols to mitigate methane emission and bean husks as a source of functional fiber to boost the number of fiber-degrading bacteria were highlighted. Other byproducts influencing rumen microbiota and fermentation profile were also described. Future application of these feed and additive candidates is very dependent on a sufficient, cost-effective supply and optimal usage in feeding practice.',\n",

Animal model was established by inoculation of HCMV (strain AD-169) or coinoculation with Hepatitis E virus (HEV) into the ligated sacculus rotundus and vermiform appendix in living rabbits. The specimens were collected from animals sacrificed 1 and a half hours after infection.ResultsThe virus was found to be capable of reproducing in these specimens through RT-PCR and Western-blot. Severe inflammation damage was found in HCMV-infected tissue. The viral protein could be detected in high amounts in the mucosal epithelium and lamina propria by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescense. Moreover, there are strong positive signals in lymphocytes, macrophages, and lymphoid follicles. Quantitative statistics indicate that lymphocytes among epithlium cells increased significantly in viral infection groups.ConclusionsThe results showed that HCMV or HEV\\u2009+\\u2009HCMV can efficiently infect in rabbits by vivo ligated intestine loop inoculation. The present study successfully developed an infective model in vivo rabbit ligated intestinal Loop for HCMV pathogenesis study.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractAntimicrobials are critical to contemporary high-intensity beef production. Many different antimicrobials are approved for beef cattle, and are used judiciously for animal welfare, and controversially, to promote growth and feed efficiency. Antimicrobial administration provides a powerful selective pressure that acts on the microbial community, selecting for resistance gene determinants and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria resident in the bovine flora. The bovine microbiota includes many harmless bacteria, but also opportunistic pathogens that may acquire and propagate resistance genes within the microbial community via horizontal gene transfer. Antimicrobial-resistant bovine pathogens can also complicate the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in beef feedlots, threatening the efficiency of the beef production system. Likewise, the transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes to bovine-associated human pathogens is a potential public health concern. This review outlines current antimicrobial use practices pertaining to beef production, and explores the frequency of antimicrobial resistance in major bovine pathogens. The effect of antimicrobials on the composition of the bovine microbiota is examined, as are the effects on the beef production resistome. Antimicrobial resistance is further explored within the context of the wider beef production continuum, with emphasis on antimicrobial resistance genes in the food chain, and risk to the human population.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCryopreservation of epididymal spermatozoa is important in cases in which it is not possible to collect semen using normal methods, as the sudden death of an animal or a catastrophic injury. However, the freezing and thawing processes cause stress to spermatozoa, including cold shock, osmotic damage, and ice crystal formation, thereby reducing sperm quality. We assessed the motility (%), motion kinematics, capacitation status, and viability of spermatozoa using computer-assisted sperm analysis and Hoechst 33258/chlortetracycline fluorescence staining. Moreover, we identified proteins associated with cryostress using a proteomic approach and performed western blotting to validate two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) results using two commercial antibodies.ResultsCryopreservation reduced viability (%), motility (%), straight-line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and capacitated spermatozoa, whereas straightness (STR) and the acrosome reaction increased after cryopreservation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Nine proteins were differentially expressed (two proteins decreased and seven increased) (>3 fold, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) before and after cryopreservation. The proteins differentially expressed following cryopreservation are putatively related to several signaling pathways, including the ephrinR-actin pathway, the ROS metabolism pathway, actin cytoskeleton assembly, actin cytoskeleton regulation, and the guanylate cyclase pathway.ConclusionThe results of the current study provide information on epididymal sperm proteome dynamics and possible protein markers of cryo-stress during cryopreservation. This information will further the basic understanding of cryopreservation and aid future studies aiming to identify the mechanism of cryostress responses.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractGrowing evidence suggests the implication of the gut microbiota in various facets of health and disease. In this review, the focus is put on microbiota-host molecular cross-talk at the gut epithelial level with special emphasis on two defense systems: intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and inducible heat shock proteins (iHSPs). Both IAP and iHSPs are induced by various microbial structural components (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, CpG DNA motifs), metabolites (e.g. n-butyrate) or secreted signal molecules (e.g., toxins, various peptides, polyphosphate). IAP is produced in the small intestine and secreted into the lumen and in the interior milieu. It detoxifies microbial components by dephosphorylation and, therefore, down-regulates microbe-induced inflammation mainly by inhibiting NF-κB pro-inflammatory pathway in enterocytes. IAP gene expression and enzyme activity are influenced by the gut microbiota. Conversely, IAP controls gut microbiota composition both directly, and indirectly though the detoxification of pro-inflammatory free luminal adenosine triphosphate and inflammation inhibition. Inducible HSPs are expressed by gut epithelial cells in proportion to the microbial load along the gastro-intestinal tract. They are also induced by various microbial components, metabolites and secreted molecules. Whether iHSPs contribute to shape the gut microbiota is presently unknown. Both systems display strong anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties that are protective to the gut and the host. Importantly, epithelial gene expressions and protein concentrations of IAP and iHSPs can be stimulated by probiotics, prebiotics and a large variety of dietary components, including macronutrients (protein and amino acids, especially L-glutamine, fat, fiber), and specific minerals (e.g. calcium) and vitamins (e.g. vitamins K1 and K2). Some food components (e.g. lectins, soybean proteins, various polyphenols) may inhibit or disturb these systems. The general cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the microbiota-host epithelial crosstalk and subsequent gut protection through IAP and iHSPs are reviewed along with their nutritional modulation. Special emphasis is also given to the pig, an economically important species and valuable biomedical model.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn order to improve ICSI, appropiate sperm selection and oocyte activation is necessary. The objective of the present study was to determine the efficiency of fertilization using ICSI with chemically activated ovine oocytes and sperm selected by swim up (SU) or swim up\\u2009+\\u2009zona pellucida (SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP) binding.ResultsExperiment 1, 4–20 replicates with total 821 in vitro matured oocytes were chemically activated with ethanol, calcium ionophore or ionomycin, to determine oocyte activation (precense of one PN). Treatments showed similar results (54, 47, 42\\xa0%, respectively) but statistically differents (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than mechanical activated oocytes in sham, ICSI and sham injection (13, 25, 32\\xa0%, respectively) (10–17 replicates; n\\u2009=\\u2009429).Experiment 2: Twelve ejaculates and 28 straws of semen were used (11–19 replicates). Sperm were selected by SU in BSA-TCM 199-H medium. A total of 2,294 fresh sperm and 2,760 from frozen-thawed semen were analyzed after SU or SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP binding. Fresh sperm selected by SU showed acrosome reaction (AR) of 59\\xa0%, the sperm selected by SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP binding increased AR to 91\\xa0%. In comparison, the AR of frozen-thawed sperm using SU or SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP binding was 77 and 86\\xa0%, respectively (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).Experiment 3: fertilization in 200 mechanical activativated oocytes (17 replicates) was 4\\xa0%, but fertilization increased in ethanol activated oocytes after ICSI (12-28\\xa0%) (5–6 replicates). When fresh sperm only selected by SU were injected to 123 oocytes, a fertilization rate (28\\xa0%) was achieved; in sperm selected by SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP was 25\\xa0% (73 oocytes). In comparison, in frozen-thawed sperm selected by SU, fertilization was 13\\xa0% (70 oocytes), whereas sperm from SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP binding displayed 12\\xa0% (51 oocytes) (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05).ConclusionsChemical activation induces higher ovine oocyte activation than mechanical activation. Ethanol slightly displays higher oocyte activation than calcium ionophore and ionomicine. Sperm selection with SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP increased AR/A and AR/D rates in comparison with SU in fresh and frozen-thawed sperm. According to this, in terms of fertilization rates, chemical activation after ICSI increased oocyte PN formation compared to mechanical activation. Also, fresh sperm treated with SU and SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP were significantly different than frozen-thawed sperm, but between sperm treatments no significant differences were obtained.',\n",

Contents of arginine, lysine and O-methylisourea reactive lysine (OMIU-RL) linearly decreased with increasing toasting time, with a larger decrease of OMIU-RL than lysine. First-order reactions calculated from the measured parameters show that glucosinolates were degraded faster than lysine, OMIU-RL and arginine and that physical changes to proteins seem to occur before chemical changes during toasting. Despite the drastic physical and chemical changes noticed on the proteins, the coefficient of in vitro CP digestibility ranged from 0.776 to 0.750 and there were no effects on the extent of protein hydrolysis after 120\\xa0min. In contrast, the rate of protein hydrolysis linearly decreased with increasing toasting time, which was largely correlated to the decrease in protein solubility, lysine and OMIU-RL observed. Rate of protein hydrolysis was more than 2-fold higher for the untoasted RSM compared to the 120\\xa0min toasted material.ConclusionsIncreasing the toasting time for the production of RSM causes physical and chemical changes to the proteins that decrease the rate of protein hydrolysis. The observed decrease in the rate of protein hydrolysis could impact protein digestion and utilization.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThree experiments were conducted to examine the overall hypothesis that addition of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and cysteamine hydrochloride (CSH) into the diets of young and growing pigs would stimulate the endogenous somatotropic axis to improve growth and performance.ResultsIn Experiment 1, weaner pigs were given either a 5 d dietary supplement of 5\\xa0% MCT (n\\u2009=\\u20098) or a control diet (n\\u2009=\\u20098). MCT increased the plasma concentration of growth hormone (GH; P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and the GH secretagogue, ghrelin (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, the MCT treatment reduced scouring (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), maintained villous height in the small intestine (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and stabilised daily weight gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), compared to the controls. Experiment 2 compared the effects of 4 levels (0, 1, 3 and 6\\xa0%\\xa0v/v) of MCT supplementation in grower-finisher male pigs, of approximately 35\\xa0kg live weight (n\\u2009=\\u200915 per treatment). Blood samples taken after 7\\xa0wk of treatment showed that the MCT supplementation increased circulating ghrelin (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), GH (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and insulin (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Daily weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were not affected by the MCT diets. In Experiment 3, 64 female pigs of approximately 60\\xa0kg live weight were allocated to one of three dietary treatments: control (n\\u2009=\\u200920); 6\\xa0% MCT (n\\u2009=\\u200921); and 70\\xa0mg/kg CSH (n\\u2009=\\u200921). After 3\\xa0wk of supplementation, the MCT treated pigs had a higher plasma concentration of ghrelin compared to the control and CSH pigs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Plasma concentrations of GH and weight were not affected by any of the dietary treatments.ConclusionsEvidence is provided in Experiment 1 to support the use of dietary MCT supplements, perhaps acting via stimulation of somatotropic endocrine pathways, to minimise weaning-associated disorders such as slowing of growth and diarrhoea. In Experiments 2 and 3, although there was no effect on weight gain or feed conversion ratio in either experiment, MCT and CSH increased endocrine components of the somatotropic axis.',\n",

However, this approach is tedious and depends on a subjective judgment of the analysts. There is an urgent need for automatic identification of individual animals and automatic tracking is a fundamental part of the solution to this problem.ResultsIn this study, an algorithm based on a Hybrid Support Vector Machine (HSVM) was developed for the automated tracking of individual laying hens in a layer group. More than 500\\xa0h of video was conducted with laying hens raised under a floor system by using an experimental platform. The experimental results demonstrated that the HSVM tracker outperformed the Frag (fragment-based tracking method), the TLD (Tracking-Learning-Detection), the PLS (object tracking via partial least squares analysis), the MeanShift Algorithm, and the Particle Filter Algorithm based on their overlap rate and the average overlap rate.ConclusionsThe experimental results indicate that the HSVM tracker achieved better robustness and state-of-the-art performance in its ability to track individual laying hens than the other algorithms tested. It has potential for use in monitoring animal behavior under practical rearing conditions.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundRemoval of the follicular content by ultrasound-guided transvaginal follicle aspiration (TVFA) may fail to induce immediate atresia and loss of function, resulting in the occurrence of residual follicles (RF). The aims of this study were to characterize the blood flow in RF and to determine the effects of the treatment with estradiol benzoate on RF fate. Lactating, cyclic Holstein-Gir crossbred cows were used. In Experiment 1, follicular wave emergence (D0) was synchronized in cows (n\\u2009=\\u200910) and follicular growth was then monitored by transrectal ultrasonography from D0 to D8, followed by TVFA of the largest follicle present on the ovaries 24\\xa0h later. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging was used to examine blood flow on the follicular wall, which was recorded immediately before and every 12\\xa0h after TVFA, up to 72\\xa0h. In experiment 2, cows (n\\u2009=\\u200922) were randomly allocated to receive either 2\\xa0mL of saline i.m. (Control group, n\\u2009=\\u200911) or 2\\xa0mL estradiol benzoate i.m. (EB group, n\\u2009=\\u200911) immediately after TVFA. Ovaries were scanned every 12\\xa0h to confirm the presence and to measure the diameter of RF. The contents of the RF, if present, were collected 72\\xa0h after the first TVFA, using the same aspiration procedures. Follicular fluid from original follicles and RF were stored at -20\\xa0°C until hormonal assays.ResultsIn Experiment 1, there was no reduction (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) of blood flow in the remaining follicle walls after TVFA and maximum blood flow values were observed at 49.5\\u2009±\\u200919.7\\xa0h post-TVFA. In Experiment 2, formation of RF after TVFA was proportionally similar between Controls (5/9) and EB (5/10) cows. Also, RF diameter did not differ between groups (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Nonetheless, the content of RF from cows in the EB group had lower (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0004) estradiol (E2) concentration and lower (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0005) E2:P4 ratio compared with Controls.ConclusionsIn conclusion, 1) the persistence of vascularization in the remaining follicle wall may contribute to the formation of RF after follicle aspiration, and 2) the treatment with estradiol benzoate does not prevent formation of RF, but does reduce their estradiol production.',\n",

The IAAend and the SID were determined by linear regression analysis between cAID and total dietary CP and AA.ResultsThere exist linear relationships between cAID and total CP and AA (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The IAAend of CP, Lys, Met, Thr and Trp amounted to 35.34, 1.08, 0.25, 1.02 and 0.38\\xa0g/kg DM intake (DMI), respectively, which are greater compared to average IAAend determined previously under N-free feeding conditions. The SID of CP, Lys, Met, Thr and Trp was 90, 79, 85, 79 and 86\\xa0%, respectively, and was greater when compared to tabulated values. Moreover, these SID values were greater than those reported in literature, based on correction of apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of CP and AA for their IAAend values. Summarized, the results of the present regression analysis indicate greater IAAend in barley-based diets compared to those obtained by N-free feeding.ConclusionsFor low-protein feed ingredients like barley the regression method may be preferred over correction of AID values for their IAAend determined under N-free feeding conditions, as intercepts and slopes of the linear regression equations between cAID and total dietary CP and AA provide direct estimates of IAAend and SID of CP and AA in the presence of the assay feed ingredient.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundModification of chemical composition of diets fed to dairy cows might be a good strategy to reduce methane (CH4) production in the rumen. Notable reductions of CH4 production compared to conventional high-roughages rations were more frequently observed for very concentrated diets or when fat supplements were used. In these cases, the reduction in the gas emission was mainly a consequence of an overall impairment of rumen function with a reduction of fiber digestibility. These strategies do not always comply with feeding standards used in intensive dairy farms and they are usually not applied owing to the risks of negative health and economic consequences.Thus, the present study evaluated the effects of seven commercial diets with contents of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), protein and lipids ranging 325 to 435\\xa0g/kg DM, 115 to 194\\xa0g/kg DM, and 26 to 61\\xa0g/kg DM, respectively, on in vitro degradability, gas (GP), and CH4 production.ResultsIn this experiment, changes in the dietary content of NDF, crude protein (CP) and lipids were always obtained at the expense or in favor of starch. A decreased of the dietary NDF content increased NDF (NDFd) and true DM (TDMd) degradability, and increased CH4 production per g of incubated DM (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), but not that per g of TDMd. An increase of the dietary CP level did not change in vitro NDFd and TDMd, decreased GP per g of incubated DM (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), but CH4 production per g of TDMd was not affected. An increased dietary lipid content reduced NDFd, TDMd, and GP per g of incubated DM, but it had no consequence on CH4 production per g of TDMd.ConclusionsIt was concluded that, under commercial conditions, changes in dietary composition would produce small or negligible alterations of CH4 production per unit of TDMd, but greater differences in GP and CH4 production would be expected when these amounts are expressed per unit of DM intake. The use of TDMd as a standardizing parameter is proposed to account for possible difference in DM intake and productivity.',\n",

Sixty Holstein Friesian bulls (mean liveweight 370 ± 35\\xa0kg; mean age 479 ± 15 d) were assigned to one of two groups: (i) restricted feed allowance (RES; n\\u2009=\\u200930) for 125\\xa0d (Period 1) followed by ad libitum access to feed for 55\\xa0d (Period 2) or (ii) ad libitum access to feed throughout (ADLIB; n\\u2009=\\u200930). Target growth rate for RES was 0.6\\xa0kg/d during Period 1. At the end of each dietary period, 15 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered and ruminal epithelial tissue and liquid digesta harvested from the ventral sac of the rumen. Real-time qPCR was used to quantify mRNA transcripts of 26 genes associated with ruminal epithelial function. Volatile fatty acid analysis of rumen fluid from individual animals was conducted using gas chromatography.ResultsDiet × period interactions were evident for genes involved in ketogenesis (BDH2, P\\u2009=\\u20090.017), pyruvate metabolism (LDHa, P\\u2009=\\u20090.048; PDHA1, P\\u2009=\\u20090.015) and cellular transport and structure (DSG1, P\\u2009=\\u20090.019; CACT, P\\u2009=\\u20090.027). Ruminal concentrations of propionic acid (P\\u2009=\\u20090.018) and n-valeric acid (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029) were lower in RES animals, compared with ADLIB, throughout the experiment. There was also a strong tendency (P\\u2009=\\u20090.064) toward a diet × period interaction for n-butyric with higher concentrations in RES animals, compared with ADLIB, during Period 1.ConclusionsThese data suggest that following nutrient restriction, the structural integrity of the rumen wall is compromised and there is upregulation of genes involved in the production of ketone bodies and breakdown of pyruvate for cellular energy. These results provide an insight into the potential molecular mechanisms regulating ruminal epithelial absorptive metabolism and growth following nutrient restriction and subsequent compensatory growth.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe overall breeding objective for a nucleus swine selection program is to improve crossbred commercial performance. Most genetic improvement programs are based on an assumed high degree of positive relationship between purebred performance in a nucleus herd and their relatives’ crossbred performance in a commercial herd. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between purebred and crossbred sow longevity performance. Sow longevity was defined as a binary trait with a success occurring if a sow remained in the herd for a certain number of parities and including the cumulative number born alive as a measure of reproductive success. Heritabilities, genetic correlations, and phenotypic correlations were estimated using THRGIBBS1F90.ResultsResults indicated little to no genetic correlations between crossbred and purebred reproductive traits. This indicates that selection for longevity or lifetime performance at the nucleus level may not result in improved longevity and lifetime performance at the crossbred level. Early parity performance was highly correlated with lifetime performance indicating that an indicator trait at an early parity could be used to predict lifetime performance. This would allow a sow to have her own record for the selection trait before she has been removed from the herd.ConclusionsResults from this study aid in quantifying the relationship between purebred and crossbred performance and provide information for genetic companies to consider when developing a selection program where the objective is to improve crossbred sow performance. Utilizing crossbred records in a selection program would be the best way to improve crossbred sow productivity.',\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate if lycopene has the ability to reverse ROS-mediated alterations to the motility, viability and intracellular antioxidant profile of bovine spermatozoa subjected to ferrous ascorbate (FeAA). Spermatozoa were washed out of fresh bovine semen, suspended in 2.9\\xa0% sodium citrate and subjected to LYC treatment (0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2\\xa0mmol/L) in the presence or absence of FeAA (150\\xa0μmol/L FeSO4 and 750\\xa0μmol/L ascorbic acid) during a 6\\xa0h in vitro culture. Spermatozoa motion characteristics were assessed using the SpermVision™ computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) system. Cell viability was examined with the metabolic activity (MTT) assay, ROS generation was quantified via luminometry and the nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) test was applied to quantify the intracellular superoxide formation. Cell lysates were prepared at the end of the in vitro culture to investigate the intracellular activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as well as the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA).ResultsFeAA treatment led to a reduced spermatozoa motility (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), viability (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and a decline of the antioxidant capacity of spermatozoa (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) but increased the ROS generation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), superoxide production (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and lipid peroxidation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). LYC administration resulted in a preservation of the spermatozoa motion parameters (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), mitochondrial activity (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and antioxidant characteristics (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001 with respect to SOD; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01 in relation to CAT; P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 as for GPx and GSH) with a concentration range of 1 and 2\\xa0mmol/L LYC revealed to be the most effective.ConclusionsOur results suggest that LYC exhibits significant ROS-scavenging and antioxidant properties which may prevent spermatozoa alterations caused by oxidative stress, and preserve the functionality of male reproductive cells.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundAlfalfa hay and corn stover are different type of forages which can significantly impact a cow’s lactation performance, but the underlying metabolic mechanism has been poorly studied. We used biomarker and pathway analyses to characterize related biomarkers and pathways based on urine metabolomics data from different forage treatments. Urine was collected from 16 multiparous Holstein dairy cows fed alfalfa hay (AH, high-quality forage, n\\u2009=\\u20098) and corn stover (CS, low-quality forage, n\\u2009=\\u20098) respectively. Gas chromatography–time of flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) was performed to identify metabolites in urine and the metaboanalyst online platform was used to do biomarker and pathway analysis.ResultsHippuric acid (HUA) and N-methyl-glutamic (NML-Glu) indicated the most significant difference between the two diets, when statistically validated by biomarker analysis. HUA was also validated by standard compound quantitative method and showed significant higher concentration in CS group than AH group (2.8282 vs. 0.0005\\xa0mg/mL; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The significant negative correlation between milk yield and HUA (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.459; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and significant positive correlation between milk yield and NML-Glu (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.652; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) were characterized. The pathway analysis revealed that these different metabolites were involved in 17 pathways including 7 influential pathways (pathway impact value\\u2009>\\u20090): Tyr metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, galactose metabolism, Phe, Tyr and Try biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. Based on the metabolome view map, the Phe, Tyr and Try biosynthesis pathway exhibited the highest impact value (0.50), and the Holm-Bonferroni multiple testing-based analysis revealed the most significant difference in the Tyr metabolism pathway (Holm P\\u2009=\\u20090.048).ConclusionsThe identified HUA and NML-Glu may serve as potential biomarkers for discriminating CS and AH diets and could be used as candidates for milk yield related mechanistic investigations. Integrated network pathways associated with related metabolites provide a helpful perspective for discovering the effectiveness of forage quality in lactation performance and provides novel insights into developing strategies for better utilization of CS and other low-quality forage in China.',\n",

The skeletal muscle of different locations in pigs, including longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM), psoas major muscle (PMM) and biceps femoris muscle (BFM) were collected and analyzed.ResultsResults showed that growing-finishing pigs fed the MP or AP diet improved (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) the average daily gain and feed: gain ratio compared with those fed the LP diet, and the MP diet tended to increase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) the weight of LDM. Moreover, the ATP content and energy charge value were varied among muscle samples from different locations of pigs fed the reduced protein diets. We also observed that pigs fed the MP diet up-regulated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) muscular mRNA expression of all the selected key genes, except that myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIb, MyHC IIx, while mRNA expression of ubiquitin ligases genes was not affected by dietary CP level. Additionally, the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway was stimulated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in skeletal muscle of the pigs fed the MP or AP diet compared with those fed the LP diet.ConclusionThe results suggest that the pigs fed the MP diet could catch up to the growth performance and the LDM weight of the pigs fed the AP diet, and the underlying mechanism may be partly due to the alteration in energy status, modulation of muscle fiber characteristics and mTORC1 activation as well as its downstream effectors in skeletal muscle of different locations in growing-finishing pigs.',\n",

Both villus height and ratio of villus height to crypt depth averaged across the small intestine of piglets were higher in the DLM and HMTBA groups than in the control group. Piglet jejunal oxidized glutathione concentration and ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione were lower in the HMTBA group than in the DLM and control groups. However, piglet jejunal aminopeptidase A, carnitine transporter 2 and IGF-II precursor mRNA abundances were higher in the DLM group than in the HMTBA and control groups.ConclusionIncreasing maternal consumption of methionine as DLM and HMTBA promoted neonatal intestinal growth by increasing morphological development or up-regulating expression of genes responsible for nutrient metabolism.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe ability of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) content of corn fed to growing pigs was tested. One hundred and seventeen corn samples, comprising different planting regions and varieties were collected from all over China in a three-year period. The samples were randomly split into a calibration set (n\\u2009=\\u200988) and a validation set (n\\u2009=\\u200929). The actual and calculated DE and ME content of the corn samples was determined by digestion-metabolism experiments and the prediction equations of Noblet and Perez (J Anim Sci. 71:3389–98,1993). The samples were then subjected to NIRS scanning and calibrations were performed by the modified partial least square (MPLS) regression method based on 77 different spectral pre-treatments. The NIRS equations based on the actually determined and calculated DE and ME were built separately and then validated using validation samples.ResultsThe NIRS equations obtained from actually determined DE, the coefficient of determination for calibration (RSQcal), cross-validation (R2CV), and validation (RSQv) were 0.89, 0.87 and 0.86, and these values for determined ME were 0.87, 0.86 and 0.86. For the NIRS equations built from calculated DE, the RSQcal, R2CV, and RSQv values were 0.88, 0.85 and 0.84, and these values for calculated ME were 0.86, 0.84 and 0.82. Except for the equation based on calculated ME (RPDv\\u2009=\\u20092.38, < 2.50), the other three equations built from actually determined energy and calculated DE produced good prediction performance (RPDv ranging from 2.53 to 2.69, > 2.50) when applied to validation samples.ConclusionThese results indicate that NIRS can be used as a quantitative method for the rapid determination of the available energy in corn fed to growing pigs, and the NIRS equations based on the actually determined energy produced better predictive performance than those built from calculated energy values.',\n",

The expression of 15 lipogenic genes and 7 miRNA were evaluated. Responses to LT2.1, LT1.3, LH3.0, and LV1.6 relative to the control (OPAARMC) included up-regulated expression of ACSS2, FABP3, ACACA, FASN, SCD, LPIN1, INSIG1, SREBF1, PPARD, and NR1H3 (commonly known as LXR-α). Furthermore, LV1.6 up-regulated expression of ACSL1, DGAT1, and RXRA and down-regulated PPARG expression. Although no effect of OPAA on expression of PPARG was observed, compared with the control, OPAA up-regulated expression of the PPAR targets ACSS2, FABP3, ACACA, FASN, SCD, LPIN1, INSIG1, and SREBF1. Compared with the control, the expression of the anti-lipogenic MIR27AB was down-regulated by OPAA, LT2.1, LT1.3 and LH3.0. In contrast, compared with the control, the expression of the pro-lipogenic MIR21 was up-regulated by LT2.1, LT1.3, LH3.0, and LV1.6.ConclusionsThe observed up-regulation of lipogenic gene networks and the changes in expression of key miRNA involved in the control of lipogenic balance are indicative of a potentially important role of EAA ratios and mTOR signaling in the regulation of milk fat synthesis.',\n",

This study aimed to evaluate the redox system in tissues of finishing pigs by supplementation with high dose of daidzein (640 mg/kg).ResultsThe supplementation of high dose of daidzein for 64 d increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity in longissimus muscle but down-regulated the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase-2 and cyclooxygenase-2. In contrast, high-level supplementation with daidzein exerted pro-oxidant changes in back fat, abdominal fat, liver, and plasma, as reflected by increased contents of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, in these tissues. Furthermore, daidzein supplementation resulted in higher expression of ROS-producing enzymes, including NADPH oxidase-1 and cyclooxygenase-1 in liver, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in backfat and NADPH oxidase-2 both in abdominal fat and backfat. The supplementation of daidzein did not affect meat quality parameters in longissimus muscle, including marbling score, eye muscle areas, intramuscular fat, shear force, drip loss, pH and meat color.ConclusionsThis experiment suggests that dietary supplementation of finishing pigs with daidzein at a high dose level improves redox status in muscle but exerts pro-oxidant effect in liver and fat tissues.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe objective of this study was to characterize the mRNA expression profile related to rumen epithelial inflammation through the in vivo and in vitro experiments. In the in vivo experiment, rumen papillae were collected from four dairy cows adapted to either a 40\\xa0% (LC) or 70\\xa0% (HC) concentrate feeds for microarray analysis.ResultsResults showed that 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in the cows fed the HC relative to the LC diet. The DEGs were first annotated, and results revealed that the expression of inflammation-related genes, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-22, CCL19, CCL8, CX3CR1, CXCL6, INHBE, LEPR, PRL, and TNFRSF9 found in the cytokine-cytokine receptor pathway were up-regulated in the HC-fed cows, indicating local inflammation in the rumen epithelium was triggered. The expression of IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-6 was further validated by qRT-PCR. To demonstrate whether there were relationships between cytokine mRNA expression and ruminal factors (pH and LPS), the isolated ruminal epithelial cells were cultured in vitro. Results showed that the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8 increased after the LPS treatment, while low-pH treatment elevated the mRNA expression of TNF-α, suggesting that low-pH coupled with higher levels of LPS in rumen of cows fed the HC may be mainly responsible for the triggered local ruminal inflammation.ConclusionsOur results indicate that ruminal local inflammation response might be triggered during HC feeding, and these findings also enhance the knowledge of rumen epithelial adaptation to HC at the molecular level.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCalcium is a vital mineral and an indispensable component of milk for ruminants. The regulation of transcellular calcium transport by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3, the active form of vitamin D) has been confirmed in humans and rodents, and regulators, including vitamin D receptor (VDR), calcium binding protein D9k (calbindin-D9k), plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1b (PMCA1b), PMAC2b and Orai1, are involved in this process. However, it is still unclear whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 could stimulate calcium transport in the ruminant mammary gland. The present trials were conducted to study the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 supplementation and energy availability on the expression of genes and proteins related to calcium secretion in goat mammary epithelial cells.MethodsAn in vitro culture method for goat secreting mammary epithelial cells was successfully established. The cells were treated with different doses of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (0, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0\\xa0nmol/L) for calcium transport research, followed by a 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA, an inhibitor of glucose metabolism) treatment to determine its dependence on glucose availability. Cell proliferation ratios, glucose consumption and enzyme activities were measured with commercial kits, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blots were used to determine the expression of genes and proteins associated with mammary calcium transport in dairy goats, respectively.Results1,25-(OH)2D3 promoted cell proliferation and the expression of genes involved in calcium transport in a dose-dependent manner when the concentration did not exceed 10.0\\xa0nmol/L. In addition, 100.0\\xa0nmol/L 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of associated genes compared with the 10.0\\xa0nmol/L treatment. The inhibition of hexokinase 2 (HK2), a rate-limiting enzyme in glucose metabolism, decreased the expression of PMCA1b and PMCA2b at the mRNA and protein levels as well as the transcription of Orai1, indicating that glucose availability was required for goat mammary calcium transport. The optimal concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 that facilitated calcium transport in this study was 10.0\\xa0nmol/L.ConclusionsSupplementation with 1,25-(OH)2D3 influenced cell proliferation and regulated the expression of calcium transport modulators in a dose- and energy-dependent manner, thereby highlighting the role of 1,25-(OH)2D3 as an efficacious regulatory agent that produces calcium-enriched milk in ruminants when a suitable energy status was guaranteed.',\n",

Folic acid is involved in one carbon metabolism and contributes to DNA methylation which is related to gene expression. The purpose of this study was to explore whether folic acid could regulate IGF2 expression via epigenetic mechanism and further promote embryonic growth of new-hatched broilers.MethodsIn the present study, 360 fertile eggs were selected and randomly assigned to four treatments. On 11 embryonic day of incubation (E11), 0, 50, 100 and 150\\xa0μg folic acid were injected into eggs respectively. After hatched, growth performance of broilers were calculated. Hepatic IGF2 expression, methylation level and chromatin structure of promoter region were analyzed.ResultsResults have showed that IGF2 expression was up-regulated in 150\\xa0μg folic acid group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and other two dose of folic acid did not affect gene expression (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Meanwhile, methylation level of IGF2 promoter were lower in 100 and 150\\xa0μg groups, which was consistent with lower expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). What’s more, chromatin looseness of IGF2 promoter was higher in 150\\xa0μg group than control group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Further, birth weight (BW), liver and bursa index of new-hatched chickens in 150\\xa0μg folic acid group were higher than the other groups (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). There were positive correlations between hepatic IGF2 expression and BW and organs index (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionIn conclusion, our data have demonstrated that 150\\xa0μg folic acid injection on E11 could up-regulate IGF2 expression by modulating DNA hypomethylation and improving chromatin accessibility in the gene promoter region, and ulteriorly facilitate embryonic growth and organ development of broilers.',\n",

Wheat straw and wood chips were treated with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Lentinula edodes with various amounts of colonized millet grains (0.5, 1.5 or 3.0 % per g of wet weight of substrate) added to the substrates. Also, wheat straw and wood chips were chopped to either 0.5 or 2 cm. Effectiveness of the fungal treatment after 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 wk of incubation was determined by changes in chemical composition, in vitro gas production (IVGP) as a measure for rumen degradability, and ergosterol content as a measure of fungal biomass.ResultsIncomplete colonization was observed for C. subvermispora treated wheat straw and L. edodes treated wood chips. The different particle sizes and amounts of inoculum tested, had no significant effects on the chemical composition and the IVGP of C. subvermispora treated wood chips. Particle size did influence L. edodes treatment of wheat straw. The L. edodes treatment of 2 cm wheat straw resulted in a more selective delignification and a higher IVGP than the smaller particles. Addition of 1.5 % or 3 % L. edodes inoculum to wheat straw resulted in more selective delignification and a higher IVGP than addition of 0.5 % inoculum.ConclusionParticle size and amount of inoculum did not have an effect on C. subvermispora treatment of wood chips. At least 1.5 % L. edodes colonized millet grains should be added to 2 cm wheat straw to result in an increased IVGP and acid detergent lignin (ADL) degradation.',\n",

TLR4 is the receptor for LPS which can recognize Brucella and initiate antigen-presenting cell activities that affect both innate and adaptive immunity. Consequently, transgenic sheep over-expressing TLR4 are an suitable model to investigate the effects of TLR4 on preventing Brucellosis. In this study, we generated transgenic sheep overexpressing TLR4 and aimed to evaluate the effects of different seasons (breeding and non-breeding season) on superovulation and the imported exogenous gene on growth.ResultsIn total of 43 donor ewes and 166 recipient ewes in breeding season, 37 donor ewes and 144 recipient ewes in non-breeding season were selected for super-ovulation and injected embryo transfer to generate transgenic sheep. Our results indicated the no. of embryos recovered of donors and the rate of pronuclear embryos did not show any significant difference between breeding and non-breeding seasons (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). The positive rate of exogenous TLR4 tested were 21.21 % and 22.58 % in breeding and non-breeding season by Southern blot. The expression level of TLR4 in the transgenic sheep was 1.5 times higher than in the non-transgenic group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The lambs overexpressing TLR4 had similar growth performance with non-transgenic lambs, and the blood physiological parameters of transgenic and non-transgenic were both in the normal range and did not show any difference.ConclusionsHere we establish an efficient platform for the production of transgenic sheep by the microinjection of pronuclear embryos during the whole year. The over-expression of TLR4 had no adverse effect on the growth of the sheep.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractHeat as a stressor of poultry has been studied extensively for many decades; it affects poultry production on a worldwide basis and has significant impact on well-being and production. More recently, the involvement of heat stress in inducing oxidative stress has received much interest. Oxidative stress is defined as the presence of reactive species in excess of the available antioxidant capacity of animal cells. Reactive species can modify several biologically cellular macromolecules and can interfere with cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, during the last decade, there has been an ever-increasing interest in the use of a wide array of natural feed-delivered phytochemicals that have potential antioxidant properties for poultry. In light of this, the current review aims to (1) summarize the mechanisms through which heat stress triggers excessive superoxide radical production in the mitochondrion and progresses into oxidative stress, (2) illustrate that this pathophysiology is dependent on the intensity and duration of heat stress, (3) present different nutritional strategies for mitigation of mitochondrial dysfunction, with particular focus on antioxidant phytochemicals.Oxidative stress that occurs with heat exposure can be manifest in all parts of the body; however, mitochondrial dysfunction underlies oxidative stress. In the initial phase of acute heat stress, mitochondrial substrate oxidation and electron transport chain activity are increased resulting in excessive superoxide production. During the later stage of acute heat stress, down-regulation of avian uncoupling protein worsens the oxidative stress situation causing mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue damage. Typically, antioxidant enzyme activities are upregulated. Chronic heat stress, however, leads to downsizing of mitochondrial metabolic oxidative capacity, up-regulation of avian uncoupling protein, a clear alteration in the pattern of antioxidant enzyme activities, and depletion of antioxidant reserves.Some phytochemicals, such as various types of flavonoids and related compounds, were shown to be beneficial in chronic heat-stressed poultry, but were less or not effective in non-heat-stressed counterparts. This supports the contention that antioxidant phytochemicals have potential under challenging conditions. Though substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the association between heat stress and oxidative stress, the means by which phytochemicals can alleviate oxidative stress have been sparsely explored.',\n",

The objective of the present study was to produce from one batch of a 00-rapeseed variety (17\\xa0μmol GSL/g dry matter (DM), seed grade quality) five differently processed RSM under standardized and defined conditions in a pilot plant, and to determine the impact of these different treatments on protein solubility and chemical composition, in particular with regard to contents of AA including reactive Lys (rLys) and levels of total and individual GSL.MethodsFour RSM were exposed to wet toasting conditions (WetTC) with increasing residence time in the DT of 48, 64, 76, and 93\\xa0min. A blend of these four RSM was further processed, starting with saturated steam processing (< 100\\xa0°C) and followed by exposure to dry toasting conditions (DryTC) to further reduce the GSL content in this RSM.ResultsThe contents of neutral detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber bound crude protein (CP) increased linearly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), as residence time of RSM in the DT increased from 48 to 93\\xa0min, whereas contents of total and most individual GSL and those of Lys, rLys, Cys, and the calculated ratio of Lys:CP and rLys:CP decreased linearly (P ≤ 0.05). The combination of wet heating and DryTC resulted in the lowest GSL content compared to RSM produced under WetTC, but was associated with lowest protein solubility.ConclusionsIt can be concluded that by increasing residence time in the DT or using alternative processing conditions such as wet heating combined with DryTC, contents of total and individual GSL in RSM can be substantially reduced. Further in vivo studies are warranted to elucidate if and to which extent the observed differences in protein quality and GSL content between RSM may affect digestibility and bioavailability of AA in monogastric animals.',\n",

The NDF content of feed sample incubated (NDF) was considered as a continuous variable. From an initial database of 105 papers, 58 were discarded because one of the above-mentioned factors was not stated. After discarding 17 papers, the final dataset comprised 30 papers (339 observations). A preliminary mixed model analysis was carried out on experimental data considering the study as random factor. Variables adjusted for study effect were analyzed using a backward stepwise analysis including the above-mentioned variables. The analysis showed that the extension of incubation time and reduction of NDF increased GP and CH4 values. Values of GP and CH4 also increased when rumen fluid was collected after feeding compared to before feeding (+26.4 and +9.0\\xa0mL/g DM, for GP and CH4), from bovine compared to sheep (+32.8 and +5.2\\xa0mL/g DM, for GP and CH4), and when the buffer solution did not contain N (+24.7 and +6.7\\xa0mL/g DM for GP and CH4). The increase of BRF/FS ratio enhanced GP and CH4 production (+7.7 and +3.3\\xa0mL/g DM per each class of increase, respectively). In vitro techniques for measuring GP and CH4 production are mostly used as screening methods, thus a full standardization of such techniques is not feasible. However, a greater harmonization of analytical procedures (i.e., a reduction in the number of available protocols) would be useful to facilitate comparison between results of different experiments.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractDietary lipid supplementation benefits the prolific and high-producing modern lactating sow. A comprehensive review of recent studies showed that lipid supplementation increases average daily energy intake, which is partitioned for lactation as indicated by greater milk fat output and improved litter growth rate. Recent compelling findings showed that addition of particular lipids during lactation improved the subsequent reproductive outcome of sows. Such benefits were related to the level of dietary essential fatty acids (EFA, linoleic acid, C18:2n-6; and α-linolenic acid, C18:3n-3) during lactation. Lactation diets without supplemental EFA resulted in a pronounced negative balance (intake minus milk output) of linoleic (−25.49\\xa0g/d) and α-linolenic acid (−2.75\\xa0g/d); which compromised sow fertility (farrowing rate\\u2009<\\u200975\\xa0% and culling rates\\u2009>\\u200925\\xa0% of weaned sows). This phenomenon seems to be increasingly important with advancing sow age because of a progressive reduction of body EFA pool over successive lactations. The net effect of supplemental EFA during lactation was to create a positive EFA balance, which improved the subsequent reproduction of sows. Adequate linoleic acid intake improved the proportion of sows that farrowed in the subsequent cycle (Farrowing rate (%)\\u2009=\\u2009[(−1.5\\u2009×\\u200910−3\\u2009×\\u2009linoleic acid intake (g/d)2)\\u2009+\\u2009(0.53\\u2009×\\u2009linoleic acid intake (g/d))\\u2009+\\u2009(45.2)]; quadratic P\\u2009=\\u20090.002, R2\\u2009=\\u20090.997, RMSE\\u2009=\\u20090.031). In addition, increasing linoleic acid intake increased the number of pigs born in the subsequent cycle (total pigs born (n)\\u2009=\\u2009[(9.4\\u2009×\\u200910−5\\u2009×\\u2009linoleic acid intake (g/d)2)\\u2009+\\u2009(0.04\\u2009×\\u2009linoleic acid intake (g/d))\\u2009+\\u2009(10.94)]; quadratic P\\u2009=\\u20090.002, R2\\u2009=\\u20090.997, RMSE\\u2009=\\u20090.031). Supplemental α-linolenic acid resulted in a rapid return to estrus (sows bred: sows weaned\\u2009=\\u200994.2\\xa0%; wean-to-estrus interval\\u2009=\\u20094.0 d) and achieved a high retention of pregnancy (sows pregnant: sows bred\\u2009=\\u200998\\xa0%). Collectively, we conclude that a minimum dietary intake of 10\\xa0g/d of α-linolenic acid, simultaneous with a minimum of 125\\xa0g/d of linoleic acid should be provided to\\u2009≥\\u200995\\xa0% of the sows; thereby, achieving a maximum sow reproductive efficiency through multiple mechanisms that include rapid return to estrus, high maintenance of pregnancy and large subsequent litter size in mature sows, that appear to be susceptible to EFA deficiency.',\n",

In the current study, we investigated the beneficial effects of resveratrol on in vitro porcine oocyte maturation under heat stress (HS). The effect of resveratrol, melatonin and their combination on alleviating HS was compared according to the maturation rate of oocytes and the development competence of embryos after parthenogenetic activation (PA).ResultsSupplementation with resveratrol (2.0\\xa0μmol/L) not only improved the nuclear maturation but also raised the blastocyst rate of porcine embryos’ PA from oocytes that underwent HS by increasing their glutathione (GSH) level, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and up-regulating the expression of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). It was also found that melatonin (10−7 mol/L) and the combination of resveratrol (2.0\\xa0μmol/L) plus melatonin (10−7 mol/L) exhibited more potent effects than resveratrol alone regarding their protective activities on oocyte maturation under HS.ConclusionsThis study compared the efficiencies of resveratrol, melatonin and their combination for protecting porcine oocytes from heat stress. The mechanisms are attributed to the fact that each treatment may have different ability to regulate the synthesis of steroid hormones and the expression of mature related genes.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundEmbryonic mortality during the period of implantation strongly affects litter size in pigs. Progesterone receptor (PGR) paracrine signaling has been recognized to play a significant role in embryonic implantation. IHH, NR2F2, BMP2, FKBP4 and HAND2 were proved to involve in PGR paracrine signaling. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of IHH, NR2F2, BMP2, FKBP4 and HAND2 in endometrium of pregnant sows and to further investigate these genes’ effect on litter size in pigs. Real-time PCR, western blot and immunostaining were used to study target genes/proteins expression in endometrium in pigs. RFLP-PCR was used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of target genes.ResultsThe results showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of IHH, NR2F2 and BMP2 were up-regulated during implantation period (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 or P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). All target proteins were mainly observed in luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium. Interestingly, the staining of NR2F2 and HAND2 was also strong in stroma. SNPs detection revealed that there was a -204C\\u2009>\\u2009A mutation in promoter region of NR2F2 gene. Three genotypes were found in Large White, Landrace and Duroc sows. A total of 1847 litter records from 625 sows genotyped at NR2F2 gene were used to analyze the total number born (TNB) and number born alive (NBA). The study of the effect on litter size suggested that sows with genotype CC tend to have higher litter size.ConclusionsThese results showed the expression patterns of genes/proteins involved in PGR paracrine signaling over implantation time. And the candidate gene for litter size was identified from genes involved in this signaling. This study could be a resource for further studies to identify the roles of these genes for embryonic implantation in pigs.',\n",

Occasionally bulls are known to experience a transient reduction in semen quality, thus techniques that allow improvement in semen quality could be applied in this context. The aim of this study was the evaluation of single layer and double layer centrifugation by the use of iodixanol, compared with conventional centrifugation and non-centrifuged semen, on the sperm characteristics during the cryopreservation process in bulls with normal and poor semen quality.ResultsSingle layer centrifugation and double layer centrifugation both significantly increased the percentage of normal spermatozoa and decreased the percentage of non-sperm cells in poor quality samples, while both were ineffective in those of normal quality. Sperm characteristics in poor quality samples increased after single layer centrifugation and double layer centrifugation, reaching values similar to those recorded in normal samples, and this trend is maintained after equilibration and after cryopreservation. On the other hand, SLC and DLC resulted in a consistent reduction in the spermatozoa recovered, and this resulted in a reduction of the absolute amount of spermatozoa cryopreserved in the normal samples, without a clear improvement in sperm characteristics in this type of sample.ConclusionsThese data suggested that both SLC and DLC could be performed in practice, but their application should be limited to the cases in which the quality of the spermatozoa recovered is more important than the total amount of spermatozoa.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundRecent technological advances in genomics have allowed the genotyping of cattle through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels. High-density SNP panels possess greater genome coverage and are useful for the identification of conserved regions of the genome due to selection, known as selection signatures (SS). The SS are detectable by different methods, such as the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH); and the integrated haplotype score (iHS), which is derived from the EHH. The aim of this study was to identify SS regions in Canchim cattle (composite breed), genotyped with high-density SNP panel.ResultsA total of 687,655 SNP markers and 396 samples remained for SS analysis after the genotype quality control. The iHS statistic for each marker was transformed into piHS for better interpretation of the results. Chromosomes BTA5 and BTA14 showed piHS\\u2009>\\u20095, with 39 and nine statistically significant SNPs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.00001), respectively. For the candidate selection regions, iHS values were computed across the genome and averaged within non-overlapping windows of 500 Kb. We have identified genes that play an important role in metabolism, melanin biosynthesis (pigmentation), and embryonic and bone development.ConclusionsThe observation of SS indicates that the selection processes performed in Canchim, as well as in the founder breeds (i.e. Charolais), are maintaining specific genomic regions, particularly on BTA5 and BTA14. These selection signatures regions could be associated with Canchim characterization.',\n",

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prolonged effect of GLP-2 on the growth performance of weaned piglets. Forty piglets weaned at the age of 28 d with an average BW of 6.8\\u2009±\\u20090.4\\xa0kg were assigned to four treatments: (i) non-challenged control; (ii) LPS-challenged control; (iii) LPS\\u2009+\\u2009low GLP-2; and (iv) LPS\\u2009+\\u2009high GLP-2. Piglets in groups (i), (ii), and (iv) were s.c. injected with PBS supplemented with human [Gly2]GLP-21-34 at doses of 0, 2 and 10\\xa0nmol/kg BW per day for seven consecutive days. BW, gain:feed ratio (G:F), and plasma GLP-2 levels were determined on d 0, 7, and 14 after weaning. Piglets were challenged with i.p. administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 100\\xa0μg/kg on d 14 to induce intestinal damage. Twenty-four hours later, intestinal tract samples were collected to assess intestinal morphology and quantify enzyme activity.ResultsPlasma GLP-2 levels decreased after weaning, but in the high GLP-2 group, plasma GLP-2 was maintained on d 7 and even increased to a level higher than the preweaning level on d 14 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). High GLP-2 treatment significantly increased the duodenal, jejunal and ileal weight, as well as the gross weight of the small intestine (SI), and the SI weight index (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). LPS caused villous atrophy and disrupted intestinal morphology in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. GLP-2 also significantly increased the villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio (VCR) of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Histological examination revealed that in GLP-2-treated groups, the integrity of the villus was maintained, and the villus was protected against LPS-induced damage. GLP-2 significantly increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (γ-GT), and pancreatic lipase in the duodenum and jejunum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). GLP-2 treatment also significantly increased the average daily gain (ADG) and G:F of piglets at 0 to 7, 7 to 14, as well as 0 to14 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), resulting in a significant increase of final BW in high GLP-2 pigs (P\\u2009=\\u20090.016).ConclusionsExogenous GLP-2 improved the growth of weaned piglets and protected them against LPS-induced intestinal damage. These effects may be due to the ability of GLP-2 to promote the secretion of endogenous GLP-2 to stimulate the small intestinal development.',\n",

Four ruminally cannulated sheep were used in a 4×4 Latin square design fed (21 d/period): 1) a control diet composed of alfalfa hay and concentrate pellet (CTR), 2) CTR supplemented with 7\\xa0g/d/sheep of rosemary essential oil adsorbed on an inert support (EO), 3) CTR with 10\\xa0g/d/sheep of dried and ground rosemary leaves (RL), and 4) CTR with 10\\xa0g/d of dried and ground rosemary leaves pelleted into concentrate (RL pellet). Abundance of total bacteria, archaea, protozoa, and some select bacterial species or groups was quantified using qPCR, while the community of bacteria and archaea was profiled using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.ResultsNo difference in abundance was noted for total bacteria, protozoa, or Ruminococcus flavefaciens between the control and the treatments, but the rosemary leaves, either in loose form or in pellet, decreased the abundance of archaea and the genus Prevotella (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The rosemary leaves in loose form also decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) the abundance of Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium aminophilum, while the EO increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) the abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes.

The objective of this investigation was to evaluate whether there are alterations in several selected serum variables related to innate immunity and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that precede occurrence of RP in transition Holstein dairy cows.MethodsOne hundred multiparous Holstein dairy cows were involved in the study. Blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein during the −8 to +4 wks around parturition, once per week before the morning feeding. Six healthy control cows (CON) and 6 cows with RP were selected and serum samples at −8, −4, time of diagnosis of disease, and +4 wks relative to parturition were used for analyses. All samples were analyzed for lactate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), haptoglobin (Hp), and serum amyloid A (SAA).ResultsCows with RP had greater concentrations of serum lactate, IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and SAA in comparison with CON cows. Intriguingly, elevated concentrations of all five variables were observed at −8 and −4 wks before the occurrence of RP compared to healthy cows. Cows with RP also had lower DMI and milk production vs CON animals; however milk composition was not affected by RP.ConclusionsCows with RP showed an activated innate immunity 8 wks prior to diagnosis of disease. Overall results suggest that serum IL-1, IL- 6, and TNF, and lactate can be used as screening biomarkers to indicate cows that might have health issues during the transition period.',\n",

Previous research has demonstrated that porcine ORM1 can reduce insulin stimulated glucose metabolism in porcine adipose tissue in vitro. The present study was designed to examine the preweaning ontogeny of ORM1 mRNA abundance in porcine subcutaneous adipose and to determine if ORM1 can regulate mRNA abundance of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to insulin resistance in primary cultures derived from neonatal porcine subcutaneous adipose tissue. Cultures were differentiated in vitro and subsequently the adipocyte containing cultures were incubated for 24\\xa0h with 0–5000\\xa0ng porcine ORM1/mL medium. Cultures were then harvested, total RNA extracted for use in reverse transcription and the mRNA abundance of cytokine mRNA quantified by real-time PCR.ResultsORM1 mRNA abundance within neonatal adipose tissue does not change from d\\xa01 to d\\xa021 of age and is a very small fraction relative to liver mRNA abundance. The ORM1 mRNA level in porcine adipocytes and stromal-vascular cells are similar (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Treatment with ORM1 did not affect TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α) mRNA level (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05), while interleukin 6 (IL6) mRNA abundance was reduced 32\\xa0% at 1,000\\xa0ng ORM1/mL (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). However, TNFα protein content in the cell culture media was reduced by ORM1 treatment (5,000\\xa0ng/mL, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), whereas ORM1 had no detectable effect on the media content of IL6 (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). The reduction of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) mRNA abundance by ORM1 was dose dependent (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) mRNA level was reduced 27\\xa0% by 1,000\\xa0ng ORM1/mL (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe data suggest that ORM1 has limited effects TNFα, IL6, MIF or MCP expression at the concentrations tested. Secondly, these cytokines do not appear to contribute to the reported insulin resistance induced by ORM1 in porcine adipose tissue in vitro as an increase in the abundance of these inflammatory cytokines would be predicted during an insulin resistant state.',\n",

The effect of GCs on feed intake in birds depends on their dietary energy level. But the regulation mechanism of GCs on appetite is still unclear in chickens facing to different energy level. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on hypothalamic expression of appetite-related peptides in chickens fed high/low fat diet and under fasting/feeding condition.ResultsAn interaction between DEX injection and dietary energy level was found on hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene expression in fasted chickens (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The chickens, given a DEX injection and a low fat diet treatment, had the highest CRH mRNA levels than any of the fasted chickens given treatments (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Under fasting conditions, the DEX treatment significantly increased hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and GC receptors mRNA levels (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Under re-feeding conditions, DEX treatment significantly decreased hypothalamic expression levels of NPY and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) but significantly increased the level of hypothalamic CRH expression (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionA regulatory network formed by NPY, AgRP and CRH is associated with the appetite-control by GCs.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundFat is the primary source of the volatiles that determine the characteristic flavors of animal products. Because unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) contribute to changes in flavor as a result of the oxidation process, a feeding trial was performed to investigate the effects of dietary soybean oil or antioxidants on the fatty acid and volatile profiles of the tail subcutaneous (SF) and perirenal fat tissues (PF) of fattening lambs. Thirty-six Huzhou lambs were assigned to four dietary treatments in a randomized block design. The lambs’ diets were supplemented with soybean oil (0 or 3\\xa0% of DM) or antioxidants (0 or 0.025\\xa0% of DM).ResultsNeither soybean oil nor antioxidant supplementation had an effect on lamb growth (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). In regard to tail SF, soybean oil supplementation increased the 18:2n6t (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and the total amount of volatile acids, whereas antioxidant supplementation increased the content of C18:2n6c and C18:3n3 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) but had no effect on the volatiles profile. In regard to PF, dietary soybean oil supplementation increased the C18:0 content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01); decreased the C18:1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.01), C22:1 n9 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and total UFA (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) contents; and tended to decrease the E-2-octenal (P\\u2009=\\u20090.08), E, E-2, 4-decadienal (P\\u2009=\\u20090.10), 2-undecenal (P\\u2009=\\u20090.14) and ethyl 9-decenoate (P\\u2009=\\u20090.10) contents. Antioxidant supplementation did not affect either the fatty acid content or the volatiles profile in the PF.ConclusionsTail SF and PF responded to dietary soybean oil and antioxidant supplementation in different ways. For SF, both soybean oil and antioxidant supplementation increased the levels of unsaturated fatty acids but triggered only a slight change in volatiles. For PF, soybean oil supplementation decreased the levels of unsaturated fatty acids and oxidative volatiles, but supplementation with antioxidants had little effect on PF fatty acids and the volatiles profile.',\n",

This study aimed to examine dose and time responses of algae supplementation on rumen fermentation, biohydrogenation and Butyrivibrio group bacteria in goats.MethodsSix goats were used in a repeated 3\\u2009×\\u20093 Latin square design, and offered a fixed diet. Algae were infused through rumen cannule with 0 (Control), 6.1 (L-Alg), or 18.3\\xa0g (H-Alg) per day. Rumen contents were sampled on d 0, 3, 7, 14 and 20.ResultsH-Alg reduced total volatile fatty acid concentration and acetate molar proportion (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and increased propionate molar proportion (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), whereas L-Alg had no effect on rumen fermentation. Changes in proportions of acetate and propionate in H-Alg were obvious from d 7 onwards and reached the largest differences with the control on d 14. Algae induced a dose-dependent decrease in 18:0 and increased trans-18:1 in the ruminal content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). H-Alg increased the concentrations of t9, t11-18:2 and t11, c15-18:2 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). L-Alg only seemed to induce a transient change in 18-carbon isomers, while H-Alg induced a rapid elevation, already obvious on d 3, concentrations of these fatty acid rose in some cases again on d 20. Algae had no effect on the abundances of Butyrivibrio spp. and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10), while H-Alg reduced the total bacteria abundance (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). However, this was induced by a significant difference between control and H-Alg on d 14 (-4.43\\xa0%). Afterwards, both treatments did not differ as increased variation in the H-Alg repetitions, with in some cases a return of the bacterial abundance to the basal level (d 0).ConclusionsChanges in rumen fermentation and 18-carbon UFAs metabolism in response to algae were related to the supplementation level, but there was no evidence of shift in ruminal biohydrogenation pathways towards t10-18:1. L-Alg mainly induced a transient effect on rumen biohydrogenation of 18-carbon UFAs, while H-Alg showed an acute inhibition and these effects were not associated with the known hydrogenating bacteria.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMilk is synthesized by mammary epithelial cells of lactating mammals. The synthetic capacity of the mammary gland depends largely on the number and efficiency of functional mammary epithelial cells. Structural development of the mammary gland occurs during fetal growth, prepubertal and post-pubertal periods, pregnancy, and lactation under the control of various hormones (particularly estrogen, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I, progesterone, placental lactogen, and prolactin) in a species- and stage-dependent manner. Milk is essential for the growth, development, and health of neonates. Amino acids (AA), present in both free and peptide-bound forms, are the most abundant organic nutrients in the milk of farm animals. Uptake of AA from the arterial blood of the lactating dam is the ultimate source of proteins (primarily β-casein and α-lactalbumin) and bioactive nitrogenous metabolites in milk. Results of recent studies indicate extensive catabolism of branched-chain AA (leucine, isoleucine and valine) and arginine to synthesize glutamate, glutamine, alanine, aspartate, asparagine, proline, and polyamines. The formation of polypeptides from AA is regulated not only by hormones (e.g., prolactin, insulin and glucocorticoids) and the rate of blood flow across the lactating mammary gland, but also by concentrations of AA, lipids, glucose, vitamins and minerals in the maternal plasma, as well as the activation of the mechanistic (mammalian) target rapamycin signaling by certain AA (e.g., arginine, branched-chain AA, and glutamine). Knowledge of AA utilization (including metabolism) by mammary epithelial cells will enhance our fundamental understanding of lactation biology and has important implications for improving the efficiency of livestock production worldwide.',\n",

These processes play key roles in physiological blood vessel formation and pathological angiogenesis.MethodsIn this study, we examined VEGFA gene expression in the heart, liver, and kidney of Tibetan pigs (TP), Yorkshire pigs that migrated to high altitudes (YH), and Yorkshire pigs that lived at low altitudes (YL). We used PCR and Sanger sequencing to screen for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5ʹ-flanking DNA and exons of the VEGFA gene. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blots were used to measure expression levels and PCR products were sequenced.ResultsResults showed that the VEGFA mRNA and protein expression in heart, liver and kidney of TP was higher than that in YH and YL. In addition, the mRNA sequence of the pig VEGFA gene was conserved among pig breeds, and only five SNPs were found in the 5ʹ-flanking region of the VEGFA gene, the allele frequency distributions of the 5 SNPs were not significantly different between the TP, Yorkshire (YL), and Diannan small-ear (DN) pig populations.ConclusionIn conclusion, the Tibetan pig showed high levels of VEGFA gene expression in several hypoxic tissues, which suggests that the VEGFA gene may play a major functional role in hypoxic adaptation.',\n",

A total of 448 1-day-old male broiler chicks were allocated into eight treatment groups following a 4\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement with four dietary EO dosages (0, 60, 120, or 240\\xa0mg/kg) and two infection status (with or without C. perfringens challenge from d 14 to 20).ResultsThe challenge did not impair the growth performance of birds, but induced gut lesions and increased crypt depth in the ileum (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05). It also down-regulated the claudin-1 and occludin mRNA expression (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05), up-regulated the mRNA expression of interleukin-1β (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05), tended to increase the toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 mRNA expression (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) in the ileum, and enhanced the mucosal secretory IgA production (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05).

From d −21 to calving, cows were randomly assigned to a higher-energy diet (OVE, n\\u2009=\\u20099; NEL\\u2009=\\u20091.54 Mcal/kg DM), OVE plus SM (OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM, n\\u2009=\\u200910; SM\\u2009=\\u20090.07\\xa0% of DM) or remained on CON (n\\u2009=\\u20099). All cows received the same basal lactation diet (NEL\\u2009=\\u20091.75 Mcal/kg DM). Supplementation of SM (OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM) continued until 30 d postpartum. Liver biopsies were harvested at d −10, 7, and 21 relative to parturition. Blood PMN isolated at −10, 3, and 21 d relative to calving was used to evaluate gene expression. As expected, OVE increased liver lipid content postpartum; however, cows fed OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM or CON had lower concentrations than OVE. Compared with OVE, cows in CON and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM had greater DMI postpartum and milk production. Furthermore, cows fed OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM had the greatest milk protein and fat percentage and lowest milk SCC despite having intermediate PMN phagocytic capacity. Adaptations in PMN gene expression in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM cows associated with the lower SCC were gradual increases from −10 to 21 d in genes that facilitate migration into inflammatory sites (SELL, ITGAM), enzymes essential for reducing reactive oxygen metabolites (SOD1, SOD2), and a transcription factor(s) required for controlling PMN development (RXRA). The greater expression of TLR4 on d 3, key for activation of innate immunity due to inflammation, in OVE compared with CON cows suggests a more pronounced inflammatory state. Feeding OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM dampened the upregulation of TLR4, despite the fact that these cows had similar expression of the pro-inflammatory genes NFKB1 and TNF as OVE. Cows in CON had lower overall expression of these inflammation-related genes and GSR, which generates reduced glutathione, an important cellular antioxidant.ConclusionsAlthough CON cows appeared to have a less stressful transition into lactation, SM supplementation was effective in alleviating negative effects of energy-overfeeding. As such, SM was beneficial in terms of production and appeared to boost the response of PMN in a way that improved overall cow health.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundAdult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be conveniently sampled from bone marrow, peripheral blood, muscle, adipose and connective tissue, harvested from various species, including, rodents, dogs, cats, horses, sheep, goats and human beings. The MSCs isolated from adult tissues vary in their morphological and functional properties. These variations are further complicated when cells are expanded by passaging in culture. These differences and changes in MSCs must be considered prior to their application in the clinic or in a basic research study. Goats are commonly used as animal models for bone tissue engineering to test the potential of stem cells for bone regeneration. As a result, goat MSCs isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue should be evaluated using in vitro assays, prior to their application in a tissue engineering project.ResultsIn this study, we compared the stem cell properties of MSCs isolated from goat bone marrow and adipose tissue. We used quantitative and qualitative assays with a focus on osteogenesis, including, colony forming unit, rate of cell proliferation, tri-lineage differentiation and expression profiling of key signal transduction proteins to compare MSCs from low and high passages. Primary cultures generated from each source displayed the stem cell characteristics, with variations in their osteogenic potentials. Most importantly, low passaged bone marrow MSCs displayed a significantly higher and superior osteogenic potential, and hence, will be the preferred choice for bone tissue engineering in future in vivo experiments. In the bone marrow MSCs, this process is potentially mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. On the other hand, osteogenic differentiation in the adipose tissue MSCs may involve the p44/42 MAPK pathway.ConclusionsBased on these data, we can conclude that bone marrow and fat-derived MSCs undergo osteogenesis via two distinct signaling pathways. Even though the bone marrow MSCs are the preferred source for bone tissue engineering, the adipose tissue MSCs are an attractive alternative source and undergo osteo-differentiation differently from the bone marrow MSCs and hence, might require a cell-based enhancer/inducer to improve their osteogenic regenerative capacity.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn order to improve the efficiency of bovine sperm cryopreservation process, it is important to understand how spermatozoa respond to differences in temperature as well as the ability to recover its own metabolism. The combination between flow cytometry approach and antioxidant enzymes activity allows a more sensible evaluation of sperm cell during cryopreservation. The aim of this study was to evaluate sperm attributes and antioxidant enzymes activity during different stages of cryopreservation process. Semen samples from Holstein bulls (n\\u2009=\\u20094) were separated in 3 treatments: fresh (37\\xa0°C); cooled (5\\xa0°C); and thawed. Evaluation occurred at 0\\xa0h and 2\\xa0h after incubation. Membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and DNA damages were evaluated by flow cytometry; activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and gluthatione peroxidase were measured by spectrofotometry.ResultsThere was an increase in the percentage of sperm with DNA damage in the thawed group, compared to fresh and cooled, and for 2 hs of incubation when compared to 0\\xa0h. Considering MMP, there was an increase in the percentage of cells with medium potential in thawed group when compared to fresh and cooled groups. Opposingly, a decrease was observed in the thawed group considering high mitochondrial potential. Also in the thawed group, there was an increase on cells with damaged acrosome and membrane when compared to fresh and cooled groups. Significant correlations were found between antioxidant enzymes activity and membrane or mitochondrial parameters.ConclusionBased on our results, we conclude that cryopreservation affects cellular and DNA integrity and that the critical moment is when sperm cells are exposed to freezing temperature. Also, our study indicates that intracellular antioxidant machinery (SOD and GPX enzymes) is not enough to control cryodamage.',\n",

Significant increase in α-linolenic (18:3 n-3), docosapentaenoic (22:5 n-3) and docoshexaenoic (22:6 n-3) acids were observed in egg yolk from hens fed Camelina and Flax. Total n-3 fatty acids constituted 1.19\\xa0% in Control eggs compared to 3.12 and 3.09\\xa0% in Camelina and Flax eggs, respectively (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Eggs from hens fed Camelina and Flax had the higher IgY concentration than those hens fed Control diet when expressed on a mg/g of yolk basis (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Although the egg weight was significantly lower in Camelina-fed hens, the total egg content of IgY was highest in eggs from hens fed Camelina (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe egg n-3 fatty acid and IgY enhancing effect of dietary camelina seed warrants further attention into the potential of using camelina as a functional feed ingredient in poultry feeding.',\n",

The present experiment was designed to study the maternal persistent effects of zearalenone toxicity in gestating sows on growth and muscle development of their offsprings, and the alleviation of zearalenone toxicity by modified halloysite nanotubes (MHNTs).MethodsEighteen sows were fed with one of three dietary treatments that included the following: (1) a control diet, (2) a contaminated grain diet (with 50\\xa0% moldy corn, 2.77\\xa0mg/kg ZEN), and (3) a contaminated grain diet (with 50\\xa0% moldy corn, 2.76\\xa0mg/kg ZEN)\\u2009+\\u20091\\xa0% MHNTs. Each sow was exclusively fed its experimental diets from 35 to 70 d of gestation at a total of 2\\xa0kg daily. Muscle samples were collected from six piglets per treatment at birth, weaning and finishing.ResultsThe results showed that feeding the sows with the ZEN-contaminated diets from 35 to 70 d of gestation decreased the ADG, ADFI and G:F of their offsprings (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The muscle fiber numbers in the newborn, weaning and growing-finishing pigs and the muscle fiber diameters at birth and weaning were also decreased by maternal ZEN exposure (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The expressions of IGF-I, IGF-II, Myf-5 and Mstn at birth and IGF-II, Pax7, Myf-5 and MyoD1 at weaning were altered by feeding gestating sows with ZEN-contaminated diets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The MHNTs reduced most of the ZEN-induced toxic effects: the ADG and ADFI on growth performance, the muscle fiber numbers at weaning and finishing and the muscle fiber diameters at weaning (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The expression levels of IGF-II and Mstn in newborn piglets and IGF-II and Myf-5 in weaning piglets were also prevented by adding 1\\xa0% MHNTs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe present study demonstrated that the offsprings of sows fed with ZEN-contaminated diets from 35 to 70 day of gestation exhibited weakening on growth performance, physiological changes in their muscle fibers and alterations of mRNA expression in their muscle tissues, and also indicated that MHNTs prevented most of the ZEN-induced weakening in the muscle tissues.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe goal of this study was to compare the antagonism of elevated dietary Cu (250\\xa0mg/kg) from CuSO4 on three different Zn sources (ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O; [Zn bis(−2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid)], Zn(HMTBa)2, a chelated Zn methionine hydroxy analogue; and Zn-Methionine), as measured using multiple indices of animal performance in ROSS 308 broilers.MethodsThree experiments were conducted in broiler chicks fed a semi-purified diet. All birds were fed a Zn-deficient diet (8.5\\xa0mg/kg diet) for 1\\xa0wk, and then provided with the experimental diets for 2\\xa0wks.ResultsExperiment 1 was a 2 × 2 factorial design with two levels of Cu (8 vs. 250\\xa0mg/kg diet from CuSO4) and two Zn sources at 30\\xa0mg/kg [ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O vs. Zn(HMTBa)2]. Elevated Cu impaired growth performance only in birds fed ZnSO4. Compared to ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O, Zn(HMTBa)2 improved feed intake (12\\xa0%; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and weight gain (12\\xa0%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and the benefits were more pronounced in the presence of 250\\xa0mg/kg diet Cu. Experiment 2 was a dose titration of ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O and Zn(HMTBa)2 at 30, 45, 60, and 75\\xa0mg/kg diet in the presence of 250\\xa0mg/kg CuSO4. Feed:gain was decreased and tibia Zn was increased with increasing Zn levels from 30 to 75\\xa0mg/kg. Birds fed Zn(HMTBa)2 consumed more food and gained more weight compared to birds fed ZnSO4, especially at lower supplementation levels (30 and 45\\xa0mg/kg; interaction P\\u2009<\\u20090,05). Experiment 3 compared two organic Zn sources (Zn(HMTBa)2 vs. Zn-Methionine) at 30\\xa0mg/kg with or without 250\\xa0mg/kg CuSO4. No interactions were observed between Zn sources and Cu levels on performance or tissue mineral concentrations. High dietary Cu decreased weight gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Tibia Cu and liver Cu were significantly increased with 250\\xa0mg/kg dietary Cu supplementation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). No difference was observed between the two Zn sources.ConclusionsDietary 250\\xa0mg/kg Cu significantly impaired feed intake and weight gain in birds fed ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O, but had less impact in birds fed Zn(HMTBa)2. No difference was observed between the two organic zinc sources. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chelated organic Zn is better utilized than inorganic zinc in the presence of elevated Cu.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractEstablishment of embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines has been successful in mouse and human, but not in farm animals. Development of direct reprogramming technology offers an alternative approach for generation of pluripotent stem cells, applicable also in farm animals. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent practically limitless, ethically acceptable, individuum-specific source of pluripotent cells that can be generated from different types of somatic cells. iPSCs can differentiate to all cell types of an organism’s body and have a tremendous potential for numerous applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. However, molecular mechanisms behind the reprogramming process remain largely unknown and hamper generation of bona fide iPSCs and their use in human clinical practice. Large animal models are essential to expand the knowledge obtained on rodents and facilitate development and validation of transplantation therapies in preclinical studies. Additionally, transgenic animals with special traits could be generated from genetically modified pluripotent cells, using advanced reproduction techniques. Despite their applicative potential, it seems that iPSCs in farm animals haven’t received the deserved attention. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic overview on iPSC generation in the most important mammalian farm animal species (cattle, pig, horse, sheep, goat, and rabbit), compare protein sequence similarity of pluripotency-related transcription factors in different species, and discuss potential uses of farm animal iPSCs. Literature mining revealed 32 studies, describing iPSC generation in pig (13 studies), cattle (5), horse (5), sheep (4), goat (3), and rabbit (2) that are summarized in a concise, tabular format.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThere is little information in the tropics with regard the comparative understanding of how an increased nitrogen supply in the rumen or in the intestines affects efficiency of nitrogen utilization in cattle. This study evaluated the effects of supplementation with nitrogenous compounds in the rumen, abomasum, or both on intake, digestibility and the characteristics of nitrogen utilization in cattle fed tropical forage. Four rumen- and abomasum-fistulated Nellore bulls (227\\u2009±\\u200911\\xa0kg) were used. Four treatments were evaluated: control, ruminal supplementation (230\\xa0g/d of supplemental protein in the rumen), abomasal supplementation (230\\xa0g/d of supplemental protein in the abomasum), and ruminal and abomasal supplementation (115\\xa0g/d protein in both the rumen and the abomasum). The basal forage diet consisted of Tifton 85 hay with a crude protein (CP) level of 78.4\\xa0g/kg dry matter. Casein was used as a supplement. The experiment was conducted using a 4\\u2009×\\u20094 Latin square.ResultsThere were no differences between the treatments (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) with regard to forage intake. The intake and total digestibility of CP increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) with supplementation. The nitrogen balance in the body increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and muscle protein mobilization decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) with supplementation, regardless of the supplementation site. The efficiency of nitrogen utilization did not differ among the treatments (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10).ConclusionsThe supplementation of cattle fed tropical forage with protein in the rumen, abomasum, or both similarly increased the nitrogen accretion in animal, which reflects improvements on nitrogen status in animal body.',\n",

Both TYC and HTBC populations exhibited Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) according to the χ2 test. Three variations of the two birds were detected, namely, G939A, G982A and C1014T. HTBCs with the TT genotypes exhibit increased IMF content in the chest muscles compared with the TC genotype. Thus, the G982A site could be considered a genetic marker for selecting increased IMF content in the chest muscles of HTBC. The correlation coefficients revealed that H-FABP mRNA expression was negatively correlated with the IMF content in the cardiac, chest and leg muscles of HTBC and in the cardiac and chest muscles of TYC. The relative mRNA expression of H-FABP was reduced in the cardiac and leg muscles of HTBC compared with TYC, but this difference was not observed at the protein level, as assessed by Western blot analysis.ConclusionsThese findings offer essential data that can be useful in the breeding program of HTBC and future research exploring the role of H-FABP in IMF deposition and regulation in chickens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundBovine milk contains not only a variety of nutritional ingredients but also microRNAs (miRNAs) that are thought to be secreted by the bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). The objective of this study was to elucidate the production of milk-related miRNAs in BMECs under the influence of lactogenic hormones.ResultsAccording to a microarray result of milk exosomal miRNAs prior to cellular analyses, a total of 257 miRNAs were detected in a Holstein cow milk. Of these, 18 major miRNAs of interest in the milk were selected for an expression analysis in BMEC culture that was treated with or without dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin (DIP) to induce a lactogenic differentiation. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results showed that the expressions of miR-21–5p (P\\u2009=\\u20090.005), miR-26a (P\\u2009=\\u20090.016), and miR-320a (P\\u2009=\\u20090.011) were lower in the DIP-treated cells than in the untreated cells. In contrast, the expression of miR-339a (P\\u2009=\\u20090.017) in the cell culture medium were lower in the DIP-treated culture than in the untreated culture. Intriguingly, the miR-148a expression in cell culture medium was elevated by DIP treatment of BMEC culture (P\\u2009=\\u20090.018). The medium-to-cell expression ratios of miR-103 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.025), miR-148a (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and miR-223 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.013) were elevated in the DIP-treated BMECs, suggesting that the lactogenic differentiation-induced secretion of these three miRNAs in BMECs. A bioinformatic analysis showed that the miRNAs down-regulated in the BMECs were associated with the suppression of genes related to transcriptional regulation, protein phosphorylation, and tube development.ConclusionThe results suggest that the miRNAs changed by lactogenic hormones are associated with milk protein synthesis, and mammary gland development and maturation. The elevated miR-148a level in DIP-treated BMECs may be associated with its increase in milk during the lactation period of cows.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundAccurate evaluation of SNP effects is important for genome wide association studies and for genomic prediction. The genetic architecture of quantitative traits differs widely, with some traits exhibiting few if any quantitative trait loci (QTL) with large effects, while other traits have one or several easily detectable QTL with large effects.MethodsBody weight in broilers and egg weight in layers are two examples of traits that have QTL of large effect. A commonly used method for genome wide association studies is to fit a mixture model such as BayesB that assumes some known proportion of SNP effects are zero. In contrast, the most commonly used method for genomic prediction is known as GBLUP, which involves fitting an animal model to phenotypic data with the variance-covariance or genomic relationship matrix among the animals being determined by genome wide SNP genotypes. Genotypes at each SNP are typically weighted equally in determining the genomic relationship matrix for GBLUP. We used the equivalent marker effects model formulation of GBLUP for this study. We compare these two classes of models using egg weight data collected over 8 generations from 2,324 animals genotyped with a 42\\xa0K SNP panel.ResultsUsing data from the first 7 generations, both BayesB and GBLUP found the largest QTL in a similar well-recognized QTL region, but this QTL was estimated to account for 24\\xa0% of genetic variation with BayesB and less than 1\\xa0% with GBLUP. When predicting phenotypes in generation 8 BayesB accounted for 36\\xa0% of the phenotypic variation and GBLUP for 25\\xa0%. When using only data from any one generation, the same QTL was identified with BayesB in all but one generation but never with GBLUP. Predictions of phenotypes in generations 2 to 7 based on only 295 animals from generation 1 accounted for 10\\xa0% phenotypic variation with BayesB but only 6\\xa0% with GBLUP. Predicting phenotype using only the marker effects in the 1\\xa0Mb region that accounted for the largest effect on egg weight from generation 1 data alone accounted for almost 8\\xa0% variation using BayesB but had no predictive power with GBLUP.ConclusionsIn conclusion, In the presence of large effect QTL, BayesB did a better job of QTL detection and its genomic predictions were more accurate and persistent than those from GBLUP.',\n",

Transcriptional profiles of longissimus dorsi muscle were measured using Affymetrix Genechip.ResultsResults showed that 264 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The strongest transcriptional response was clearly observed at 30 d. DEGs were assigned to several main functional terms, including transcription, apoptosis, intracellular receptor-mediated signaling, muscle organ development, fatty acid metabolic process, cell motion, regulation of glucose metabolic process, spermatogenesis and regulation of myeloid cell differentiation. We also found that transcriptional changs of several transcription cofactors might contribute to n-3 PUFAs regulated gene expression. In addition, the increased expression of IGF-1, insulin signaling pathway and the metabolism of amino acids might involve in the muscle growth induced by feeding a linseed-enriched diet. The results also provide the new evidence that the expression changes of PTPN1, HK2 and PGC-1α might contribute to the regulation of insulin sensitivity by n-3 PUFAs.ConclusionsOur finding provided correlative evidence that feeding the linseed enriched diet affact expression of genes involved in insulin signaling pathway and the metabolism of amino acids.',\n",

Twelve lactating dairy goats were randomly assigned to either a HC diet group (65 % concentrate of dry matter; n = 6) or a LC diet group (35 % concentrate of dry matter; n = 6) for 10 wk.ResultsTwenty differentially expressed spots (≥2.0-fold changes) in the hepatic tissues were excised and successfully identified using MALDI TOF/TOF. Of these, 8 proteins were up-regulated, while the rest 12 proteins were down-regulated in HC goats compared to LC. Differential expressed proteins including alpha enolase 1 (ENO1), glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), glutathione S-transferase A1 (GSTA1), ATP synthase subunit 5β (ATP5β), superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (SOD1), cytochrom c oxidase subunit Via (COX6A1) and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) were further verified by real-time PCR and/or western blot at mRNA or protein expression level. Consistent with the 2-DE results, a significant decrease of β-actin protein expression and SOD enzyme activity was observed in liver of HC goats (P < 0.05), while ENO1 protein expression was significantly up-regulated in HC compared to LC goats (P < 0.05) . However, western blot analysis did not show a significant difference of hepatic HSP60 protein between HC and LC group, which did not match the decrease of HSP60 content detected by 2-DE analysis. Real-time PCR showed that glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) and SOD1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in liver of HC goats, while cytochrom c oxidase (COX3) and ATPase 8 (ATP8) mRNAs expression were markedly increased compared to LC (P < 0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that HC diet resulted in altered expression of proteins related to catalytic and mitochondrial metabolism in the liver, and may increase the stress response with up-regulating the expression of differentiation 14 (CD14) cluster and serum amyloid A (SAA) as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) in the liver.ConclusionsThese results suggest that feeding high concentrate diet to lactating goats for 10 wk leads to the activation of the inflammatory response, and decreases the anti-oxidant capacity, and subsequently impairs the mitochondrial function in the liver.',\n",

The abundances of E-cadherin, occludin, ZO-1 and integrin mRNA were positively related to the percentage of PCNA-positive cells.ConclusionWeaning at 14 d of age induced damage to the intestinal morphology and barrier. While there was an adaptive restoration on d 7 post-weaning, the measured values did not return to the pre-weaning levels, which reflected the impairment of intercellular junctions and Kv channels.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundColibacillosis caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) results in economic losses in the poultry industry. Antibiotics are usually used to control colibacillosis, however, E. coli has varying degrees of resistance to different antibiotics. Therefore the use of probiotics is becoming accepted as an alternative to antibiotics. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Clostridium butyricum (C. butyricum) on growth performance, immune response, intestinal barrier function, and digestive enzyme activity in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli (E. coli) K88.MethodsThe chickens were randomly divided into four treatment groups for 28\\xa0days. Negative control treatment (NC) consisted of birds fed a basal diet without E. coli K88 challenge and positive control treatment (PC) consisted of birds fed a basal diet and challenged with E. coli K88. C. butyricum probiotic treatment (CB) consisted of birds fed a diet containing 2\\u2009×\\u2009107\\xa0cfu C. butyricum/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88. Colistin sulfate antibiotic treatment (CS) consisted of birds fed a diet containing 20\\xa0mg colistin sulfate/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88.ResultsThe body weight (BW) and average day gain (ADG) in the broilers of CB group were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than the broilers in the PC group overall except the ADG in the 14-21 d post-challenge. The birds in CB treatment had higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) at 3 and 7 d post-challenge, and higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentration of interleukin-4 (IL-4) at 14 d post-challenge than those in the PC treatment group. The concentration of serum endotoxin in CB birds was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) at 21 d post-challenge, and the concentrations of serum diamine oxidase in CB birds were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) at 14 and 21 d post-challenge than in PC birds. Birds in CB treatment group had higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) jejunum villi height than those in PC, NC, or CS treatment at 7, 14, and 21 d post-challenge. In comparison to PC birds, the CB birds had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) jejunum crypt depth during the whole experiment. The birds in CB or CS treatment group had higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) activities of amylase and protease at 3, 7, and 14 d post-challenge, and higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) activity of lipase at 3, 7 d post-challenge than PC birds.ConclusionsIn all, these results indicate that dietary supplementation with C. butyricum promotes immune response, improves intestinal barrier function, and digestive enzyme activities in broiler chickens challenged with E. coli K88. There is no significant difference between the C. butyricum probiotic treatment and the colistin sulfate antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the C. butyricum probiotic may be an alternative to antibiotic for broiler chickens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundDietary canthaxanthin (CX), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D3) and vitamins have been widely reported to be involved in productive and reproductive performance of broiler breeders. However, limited information is available for duck breeders. In this study, a total of 1,560 Cherry Valley SM3 duck breeder females and 312 males were used to assess if the addition of CX and 25-OH-D3 could increase the performance of duck breeders under two different dietary vitamin regimens. Four diets were used under a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement with 2 kinds of vitamin premixes (REGULAR and HIGH; HIGH premix had higher levels of all vitamins except K3 than REGULAR premix), and with or without the supplementation of the mixture of CX (6\\xa0mg/kg) and 25-OH-D3 (0.069\\xa0mg/kg). The ducks were fed ad libitum with pelleted diets based on corn-soybean meal from 38 to 77 wk of age.ResultsHIGH vitamin premix decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) of egg yolk, increased hatchability of fertile eggs (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029), increased hatchability of total eggs (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029), and decreased serum protein carbonyl level (P\\u2009=\\u20090.037) of breeder males. The mixture of CX and 25-OH-D3 increased serum calcium of breeder females (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010), decreased the cracked egg rate (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), increased the pigmentation of egg yolk (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and male bill (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and decreased MDA level of egg yolk (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and male serum (P\\u2009=\\u20090.034). Interactive effects were observed in cracked egg rate (P\\u2009=\\u20090.038), shell thickness (P\\u2009=\\u20090.011) and serum phosphorus (P\\u2009=\\u20090.026) of breeder females. HIGH vitamin premix together with the mixture of CX and 25-OH-D3 decreased cracked egg rate and increased shell thickness of duck breeders. Serum phosphorus was decreased in duck breeder females fed REGULAR vitamin premix without the addition of the CX and 25-OH-D3 mixture.ConclusionsDietary HIGH vitamin premix increased antioxidant status of eggs and breeder males, and increased hatchability. The mixture of CX and 25-OH-D3 enhanced egg shell quality, and promoted pigmentation and antioxidant status of eggs and breeder males.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundGarlic extracts have been reported to be effective in reducing methanogenesis. Related mechanisms are not well illustrated, however, and most studies have been conducted in vitro. This study investigates the effects of supplementary allicin (AL) in sheep diet on in vivo digestibility, rumen fermentation, and shifts of microbial flora.MethodsTwo experiments were conducted using Dorper\\u2009×\\u2009thin-tailed Han crossbred ewes. In experiment 1, eighteen ewes (60.0\\u2009±\\u20091.73\\xa0kg BW) were randomly assigned for 29\\xa0days to either of two dietary treatments: a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 2.0\\xa0g AL/head·day to investigate supplementary AL on nutrient digestibility and methane emissions. In experiment 2, six ewes (65.2\\u2009±\\u20092.0\\xa0kg BW) with ruminal canulas were assigned to the same two dietary treatments as in experiment 1 for 42\\xa0days to investigate supplementary AL on ruminal fermentation and microbial flora. The methane emissions were determined using an open-circuit respirometry system and microbial assessment was done by qPCR of 16S rRNA genes.ResultsSupplementary AL increased the apparent digestibility of organic matter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), nitrogen (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006), neutral detergent fiber (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and acid detergent fiber (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002). Fecal nitrogen output was reduced (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) but urinary nitrogen output was unaffected (P\\u2009=\\u20090.691), while nitrogen retention (P\\u2009=\\u20090.077) and nitrogen retention/nitrogen intake (P\\u2009=\\u20090.077) tended to increase. Supplementary AL decreased methane emissions scaled to metabolic bodyweight by 5.95\\xa0% (P\\u2009=\\u20090.007) and to digestible organic matter intake by 8.36\\xa0% (P\\u2009=\\u20090.009). Ruminal pH was unaffected (P\\u2009=\\u20090.601) while ammonia decreased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.024) and total volatile fatty acids increased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.024) in response to supplementary AL. Supplementary AL decreased the population of methanogens (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and tended to decrease that of protozoans (P\\u2009=\\u20090.097), but increased the populations of F. succinogenes (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), R. flavefaciens (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), and B. fibrisolvens (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001).ConclusionsSupplementation of AL at 2.0\\xa0g/head·day effectively enhanced OM, N, NDF, and ADF digestibility and reduced daily methane emissions (L/kg BW0.75) in ewes, probably by decreasing the population of ruminal protozoans and methanogens.',\n",

However, challenges in MSRB3 cDNA amplification have prevented further identification of MSRB3 allelic variants influencing pig ear size.ResultsWe cloned a full-length cDNA sequence of porcine MSRB3 by rapid-amplification of cDNA ends. The 3,765-bp gene contained a 5’-untranslated region (UTR) (190\\xa0bp), a coding region (552\\xa0bp), and a 3’-UTR (3,016\\xa0bp) and shared 84\\xa0%, 84\\xa0%, 87\\xa0%, 86\\xa0%, and 70\\xa0% sequence identities with human, orangutan, mouse, chicken, and zebrafish, respectively.

Tissue expression analysis using qRT-PCR revealed that MSRB3 was expressed in the heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, ear, muscle, fat, lymph, skeletal, and hypothalamic tissues.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundMale germline stem cells (MGSCs) are a subpopulation of germ cells in the testis tissue. MGSCs are capable of differentiation into spermatozoa and thus are perfect targets for genomic manipulation to generate transgenic animals.MethodThe present study was to optimize a protocol of production of transgenic mice through transduction of MGSCs in vivo using lentiviral-based vectors. The recombinant lentiviral vectors with either EF-1 or CMV promoter to drive the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgene were injected into seminiferous tubules or inter-tubular space of 7-day-old and 28-day-old mouse testes. At 5 or 6 wk post-surgery, these pre-founders were mated with wild-type C57BL/6J female mice (1.5 to 2.0-month-old).ResultsSixty-seven percent of F1 generation and 55.56\\xa0% of F2 offspring were positive for eGFP transgene under the control of EF-1 promoter via PCR analysis. The transgenic pups were generated in an injection site-and age-independent manner. The expression of transgene was displayed in the progeny derived from lentiviral vector containing CMV promoter to drive transgene, but it was silenced or undetectable in the offspring derived from lentiviral vector with transgene under EF-1 promoter. The methylation level of gDNA in the promoter region of transgene was much higher in the samples derived lentiviral vectors with EF-1 promoter than that with CMV promoter, suggesting eGFP transgene was suppressed by DNA methylation in vivo.ConclusionThis research reported here an effective strategy for generation of transgenic mice through transduction of MGSCs in vivo using lentivirus vectors with specific promoters, and the transgenic offspring were obtained in an injection site-and age-independent manner. This protocol could be applied to other animal species, leading to advancement of animal transgenesis in agricultural and biomedical fields.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe positive influence of replacing dietary starch with sugar on milk fat production has been proposed to be partially attributed to the inhibition of the rumen trans-10 biohydrogenation pathway. However, whether and how sucrose inhibits the rumen trans-10 biohydrogenation pathway remains elusive.ResultsA batch in vitro incubation system was used to evaluate effects of replacing cornstarch in a high-concentrate diet (forage to concentrate ratio\\u2009=\\u200940:60) with 0 (control), 3, 6 and 9\\xa0% of sucrose on rumen fermentation pattern, fatty acid (FA) biohydrogenation pathways and bacterial populations relating to trans-11 to trans-10 biohydrogenation pathways. Replacing dietary cornstarch with sucrose did not alter rumen pH or concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) in comparison with the control but significantly influenced the profiles of individual VFA. The molar proportions of butyrate and valerate were linearly increased, while that of acetate was quadratically decreased and those of propionate, isobutyrate and isovalerate were linearly decreased with increasing concentrations of sucrose in the diet. Furthermore, replacing cornstarch with sucrose led to a linear decrease in C18:1 trans-10, linear increases in the proportions of C18:1 trans-11, C18:2n-6 and the ratio of trans-11 to trans-10, and linear decreases in biohydrogenation of C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3. The abundance of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, a butyrate and CLA cis-9, trans-11 producer, was increased with the increasing inclusion of sucrose in the diet, while the population of Megasphaera elsdenii, a CLA trans-10, cis-12 producer, was significantly decreased by all levels of sucrose replacements.ConclusionsThese results indicate that replacing starch in a high-concentrate diet with sucrose increased butyrate production and inhibited the rumen trans-10 biohydrogenation pathway, which was at least partially due to increased abundance of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and decreased abundance of Megasphaera elsdenii.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of an EO product and its components thymol and carvacrol in vitro, and the efficacy of EO to control Clostridium perfringens challenge in broiler chickens.ResultsThe in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration assay showed strong antibacterial activity of the EO product, thymol, and carvacrol against pathogenic Escherichia coli, C. perfringens, and Salmonella strains, and weak activity towards beneficial Lactobacillus strains. Besides, an additive effect was observed between thymol and carvacrol. The in vivo study was carried out with 448 male broiler chicks following a 4\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement to test the effects of EO supplementation (0, 60, 120, or 240\\xa0mg/kg EO in wheat-based diet), pathogen challenge (with or without oral gavage of C. perfringens from day 14 to day 20) and their interactions. Each treatment consisted of eight replicate pens (seven birds/pen). The challenge led to macroscopic gut lesions, and resulted in a significant increase in ileal populations of C. perfringens and Escherichia subgroup (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05) on day 21. Dietary EO supplementation did not influence C. perfringens numbers, but linearly alleviated intestinal lesions on day 21 and 28 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010 and 0.036, respectively), and decreased Escherichia populations in ileum with increased EO dosages (P\\u2009=\\u20090.027 and 0.071 for day 21 and 28, respectively). For caecum, EO quadratically influenced Lactobacillus populations on day 21 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002), and linearly decreased the numbers of total bacteria and Escherichia on day 28 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.026 and 0.060, respectively). Mean thymol and carvacrol concentrations in the small intestine were 0.21 and 0.20\\xa0μg/g in intestinal digesta (wet weight), respectively, for birds fed 60\\xa0mg/kg EO, and 0.80 and 0.71\\xa0μg/g, respectively, for birds fed 240\\xa0mg/kg EO.ConclusionsThese results indicated that dietary EO supplementation could affect intestinal microbiota and alleviate intestinal lesions in broilers, which may contribute in controlling C. perfringens infection in broiler chickens.',\n",

The co-products include copra meal, copra expellers, palm kernel meal, and palm kernel expellers. All 4 ingredients are very high in fiber and the energy value is relatively low when fed to pigs. The protein concentration is between 14 and 22\\xa0% and the protein has a low biological value and a very high Arg:Lys ratio. Digestibility of most amino acids is less than in soybean meal but close to that in corn. However, the digestibility of Lys is sometimes low due to Maillard reactions that are initiated due to overheating during drying. Copra and palm kernel ingredients contain 0.5 to 0.6\\xa0% P. Most of the P in palm kernel meal and palm kernel expellers is bound to phytate, but in copra products less than one third of the P is bound to phytate. The digestibility of P is, therefore, greater in copra meal and copra expellers than in palm kernel ingredients. Inclusion of copra meal should be less than 15\\xa0% in diets fed to weanling pigs and less than 25\\xa0% in diets for growing-finishing pigs. Palm kernel meal may be included by 15\\xa0% in diets for weanling pigs and 25\\xa0% in diets for growing and finishing pigs.Rice bran contains the pericarp and aleurone layers of brown rice that is removed before polished rice is produced. Rice bran contains approximately 25\\xa0% neutral detergent fiber and 25 to 30\\xa0% starch. Rice bran has a greater concentration of P than most other plant ingredients, but 75 to 90\\xa0% of the P is bound in phytate. Inclusion of microbial phytase in the diets is, therefore, necessary if rice bran is used. Rice bran may contain 15 to 24\\xa0% fat, but it may also have been defatted in which case the fat concentration is less than 5\\xa0%. Concentrations of digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) are slightly less in full fat rice bran than in corn, but defatted rice bran contains less than 75\\xa0% of the DE and ME in corn. The concentration of crude protein is 15 to 18\\xa0% in rice bran and the protein has a high biological value and most amino acids are well digested by pigs. Inclusion of rice bran in diets fed to pigs has yielded variable results and based on current research it is recommended that inclusion levels are less than 25 to 30\\xa0% in diets for growing-finishing pigs, and less than 20\\xa0% in diets for weanling pigs. However, there is a need for additional research to determine the inclusion rates that may be used for both full fat and defatted rice bran.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCYP11A1, a gene belonging to the family 11 of cytochrome P450, encodes a crucial steroidogenic enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in the production of all classes of steroids. Many studies show that CYP11A1 plays a role in ovary function. However, the role of CYP11A1 in goose reproductive cycle remains largely unknown.ResultsIn this study, full-length CYP11A1 cDNA of Zhedong goose was obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA consisted of a 96-base pair (bp) 5′untranslated region (UTR), a 179-bp 3′UTR and a 1509-bp open reading frame. The open reading frame encodes a putative 503 amino acid protein that shares high homology with CYP11A1 of other birds. The amino acid sequence possesses conserved domains of the P450 superfamily, which include the steroid-binding domain and the heme-binding region. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed CYP11A1 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously in every Zhedong goose tissue analyzed, including the heart, liver, glandular stomach, lung, spleen, kidney, intestinum tenue, intestinum crassum, cerebrum, cerebellum, muscle, oviduct, pituitary, hypothalamus and ovary.. The relatively low levels of CYP11A1 mRNA were detected in pituitary, ovary and oviduct tissues at ovulation when compared with levels at oviposition. Interestingly, higher expression was observed in ovary and oviduct tissues during brooding. Lastly, higher mRNA expression of Yangzhou geese was detected during the ovulation period than that of Zhedong geese.ConclusionsOur findings reveal the sequence characterization and expression patterns of the CYP11A1 gene during the goose reproductive cycle, which may provides correlative evidence that CYP11A1 expression is important in reproduction activity.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIdentification of genetic variants, including SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), CNVs (Copy Number Variations) and alternative splicing, within functional genes has received increasing attention in animal science research. HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor) is a very important growth factor that works as a mitogen or a morphogen during tissue growth, development and regeneration. However, to date, the functions of genetic variants within the bovine HGF gene, particularly their effects on mRNA expression, have not been determined well.ResultsThe present study aimed to perform association analysis between genetic variants and mRNA expression for the bovine HGF gene in Qinchuan cattle using various strategies, including PCR-RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), qPCR (Quantitative Real-time quantitative PCR), TA cloning, DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. A total of five SNPs were identified and only SV1 locus significantly affected HGF mRNA expression in fetal skeletal muscle (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Heterozygous genotype individuals showed significantly higher HGF expression (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), which was significantly greater in the “CTCCAGGGTT” combined genotype than that in the “CCCCGGGGTT” combined genotype (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, two alternative splicing variations, HGF-W and HGF-M, were identified, which resulted from alternative 3′ splice sites of exon 5, and HGF-W showed higher mRNA levels than HGF-M in all tissues.ConclusionIn summary, genetic variations within the HGF gene affected mRNA expression. These findings provide new insight into the molecular characteristics and functions of bovine HGF.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe purpose of this study was to investigate how inclusion of chicory forage or ribwort forage in a cereal-based diet influenced the fecal microbial community (microbiome) in newly weaned (35\\xa0days of age) piglets. The piglets were fed a cereal-based diet without (B) and with inclusion (80 and 160\\xa0g/kg air-dry forage) of vegetative shoots of chicory (C) and leaves of ribwort (R) forage in a 35-day growth trial. Fecal samples were collected at the start (D0), 17 (D17) and 35 (D35) days after weaning and profiles of the microbial consortia were generated using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). 454-FLX pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was used to analyze the microbial composition in a subset of the samples already analyzed with T-RFLP.ResultsThe microbial clustering pattern was primarily dependent on age of the pigs, but diet effects could also be observed. Lactobacilli and enterobacteria were more abundant at D0, whereas the genera Streptococcus, Treponema, Clostridium, Clostridiaceae1 and Coprococcus were present in higher abundances at D35. Pigs fed ribwort had an increased abundance of sequences classified as Treponema and a reduction in lactobacilli. However, the abundance of Prevotellaceae increased with age in on both the chicory and the ribwort diet. Moreover, there were significant correlations between the abundance of Bacteroides and the digested amount of galactose, uronic acids and total non-starch polysaccharides, and between the abundance of Bacteroidales and the digested amount of xylose.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that both chicory and ribwort inclusion in the diet of newly weaned pigs influenced the composition of the fecal microbiota and that digestion of specific dietary components was correlated with species composition of the microbiota. Moreover, this study showed that the gut will be exposed to a dramatic shift in the microbial community structure several weeks after weaning.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe current study was carried out to determine effects of dietary protein source and crude protein (CP) level on carcass characteristics, meat quality, and muscle amino acid (AA) profile in finishing gilts. The experiment was designed as a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement with two sources of dietary proteins (cottonseed meal, CSM vs. soybean meal, SBM) and two levels of CP (12\\xa0% vs. 14\\xa0%, as-fed basis). Seventy-two crossbred gilts (89.5\\u2009±\\u20090.9\\xa0kg) were allotted to one of four dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design for a period of 28 d. All diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and similar concentrations of standardized ileal digestible essential AA covering the nutrient requirements of pigs.ResultsGrowth, carcass characteristics and meat quality were not affected by dietary protein source nor crude protein level (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) except that average daily feed intake was increased by CSM diets (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03). Gilts offered reduced protein diets had lower muscle pH45min (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Neither dietary protein source nor crude protein level influenced N deposition. However, reduced protein diets decreased N intake, N excretion, and serum urea nitrogen content, whilst improved N efficiency (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). CSM diets increased N intake (P\\u2009=\\u20090.04), but did not depress N efficiency. The concentrations of phenylalanine, tryptophan, cysteine and tyrosine (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) of the longissimus muscle were decreased when gilts offered CSM diets, while muscle intracellular free valine concentration was increased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03). The gilts offered reduced protein diets had greater intracellular concentrations of free methionine, lysine, and total AA in muscle (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionThese results suggest that CSM could replace SBM as a primary protein source in finishing pig diets in terms of performance, N efficiency, carcass characteristics, and meat quality, but decrease the concentrations of muscle specific AA. Furthermore, the reduced protein diet played an important role in increasing muscle intracellular concentrations of specific free amino acids (FAA), and in reducing the relative ratios of specific FAA to lysine in longissimus dorsi muscle of pig, whose biological meaning needs further studies.',\n",

Nonetheless, enhancing the unsaturated fatty acid content of ruminant meat can have adverse effects on the shelf life and quality attributes of the meat. This study assessed the effects of dietary 80\\xa0% canola oil and 20\\xa0% palm oil blend (CPOB) on fatty acid composition, antioxidants, oxidative spoilage, cholesterol and physicochemical properties of semimembranosus (SM) muscle from goats. Twenty four Boer bucks were randomly assigned to diets containing on dry matter basis 0, 4 and 8\\xa0% CPOB, fed for 100 d and slaughtered. The carcasses were subjected to a 7 d postmortem refrigerated storage. All analyses were conducted on the SM muscle.ResultsDiet had no effect (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) on the concentration of free thiol and carbonyl and the band intensity of myosin heavy chain, actin and troponin T. The muscle glycogen, pH, water holding capacity, tenderness, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, total carotenoid, δ-tocopherol, cholesterol and proximate composition did not differ (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) between diets. The SM muscle from goats fed 4 and 8\\xa0% CPOB had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentration of C14:0 and C16:0 and higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentration of C18:1 trans-11, C18:1ω-9, C18:3ω-3, C20:5ω-3 and C22:5ω-3 than the SM muscle from the control goats. Dietary CPOB increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) the concentration of α and γ tocopherol and meat redness (a*) on d 1 and 4 postmortem.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractEarly equine pregnancy shares many features with that of more intensively assessed domestic animals species, but there are also characteristic differences. Some of those are poorly understood. Descent of the equine conceptus into the uterine lumen occurs at day 5 to 6 after ovulation but is only possible when the embryo secretes prostaglandin E2. Although maintenance of equine pregnancy probably involves secretion of a conceptus derived anti-luteolytic factor, this agent has not been identified. Rapid growth, conceptus mobility and presence of an acellular capsule at the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy, i.e. between days 12 and 14, are prerequisites to avoid pregnancy loss. Progesterone together with 5α-pregnanes is secreted by the corpus luteum and induces the production of endometrial histotroph which is responsible for conceptus nutrition until placention. A stable contact between the outer trophoblast layer of the allantochorion and the luminal epithelium of the endometrium is not established before days 40 to 42 of pregnancy.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundDietary nucleotides, considered as antibiotics alternative, were shown to have positive effects on intestinal hyperaemia, systemic immunity, small-intestinal growth, and hepatic composition in pigs. However, there is no previous research on nucleotide supplementation in weanling pigs under an oral challenged E. coli K88. Therefore, 2 experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of dietary nucleotides on weanling pig growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal score, and blood profile after being orally challenged with E. coli K88.MethodsIn Exp. 1, a total of 140 weanling pigs [8.33\\u2009±\\u20090.33\\xa0kg of body weight (BW), 28-d old] were used in this 42-d feeding trial. Pigs were distributed into 1 of 4 treatments, 5 pigs/pen (3 barrows and 2 gilts) and 7 pens/treatment. Treatments were a control basal diet (CON) or the CON supplemented with 150 (R150), 220 (R220), or 275 (R275) mg/kg to give the three treatment diets. In Exp. 2, 28 weanling pigs (BW\\u2009=\\u20098.40\\u2009±\\u20090.22\\xa0kg, 28-d old) were distributed into 1 of 4 treatments to give 1 pig/pen and 7 pens/treatment in a 42-d feeding and challenge trial. Dietary treatments were the same as in Exp. 1. On d 14, all those pigs (BW\\u2009=\\u200913.3\\u2009±\\u20090.15\\xa0kg, 42-d old) were orally dosed with 1.5\\xa0mL suspension containing 1010\\xa0cfu/mL of E. coli K88. Twenty four hours after challenge, blood and excreta samples were collected from each pigs for analysis. Fecal scores were measured on d 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the study.ResultsIn Exp. 1, overall BW, average daily gain (ADG), gain/feed (G/F) ratio, and nutrient digestibilities were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in CON group compared with the nucleotides fed pigs. In Exp. 2, after challenge, IgA, IgM, and IGF-I were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the nucleotide groups compared with CON. However, the nucleotide groups had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) cortisol and TNF-α compared with CON. Fecal E. coli counts and fecal score for the nucleotide groups were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than for CON.ConclusionsIn conclusion, dietary nucleotides supplementation could improve growth performance, nutrient digestibility, immune status, microbial balance, reduce diarrhea, and provide protection against enterotoxigenic E. coli K88 infection in weanling pigs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe redox status of intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) piglets post-weaning has been poorly studied.MethodsNewborns from twenty-four sows were weighted, weaned at 21 d and fed a starter diet until sampling. Sampling was done at 14 d post-weaning. A piglet was defined as IUGR when its birth weight was 2 SD below the mean birth weight of the total population. At weaning, eighteen piglets with nearly equal body weight from each category (i.e. IUGR or normal birth weight (NBW) piglets) were selected and then allocated to two treatments, consisted of six replicates with each pen having three piglets.ResultsCompared with NBW group, IUGR significantly decreased average daily gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), average daily feed intake (P\\u2009=\\u20090.003), and feed efficiency (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) of piglets during the first two weeks post-weaning. IUGR decreased the activities of total antioxidant capacity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.019), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD, P\\u2009=\\u20090.023), and ceruloplasmin (P\\u2009=\\u20090.044) but increased the levels of malondialdehyde (P\\u2009=\\u20090.040) and protein carbonyl (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010) in plasma. Similarly, the decreased activities of T-SOD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.005), copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD, P\\u2009=\\u20090.002), and catalase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.049) was observed in the liver of IUGR piglets than these of NBW piglets. IUGR decreased hepatic Cu/Zn-SOD activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.023) per unit of Cu/Zn-SOD protein in piglets when compared with NBW piglets. In addition, IUGR piglets exhibited the decreases in accumulation of copper in both plasma (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and liver (P\\u2009=\\u20090.014), as well as the concentrations of iron (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002) and zinc (P\\u2009=\\u20090.048) in liver. Compared with NBW, IUGR down-regulated mRNA expression of Cu/Zn-SOD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.021) in the liver of piglets.ConclusionsThe results indicated that IUGR impaired antioxidant capacity and resulted in oxidative damage in fully weaned piglets, which might be associated with the decreased levels of redox-active trace minerals. This study highlights the importance of redox status in IUGR offspring and provides a rationale for alleviating oxidative damage by dietary interventions aiming to supplement trace minerals and to restore redox balance in the future.',\n",

Diets and water were provided ad libitum to the piglets during 3-week experiment. Growth performance of piglets was measured weekly. Samples of blood and small intestine were collected at days 7 and 21 of experiment. Dietary supplementation with LY and SFY improved G:F of piglets at days 1-21 of the experiment (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared to Control group. Serum concentrations of growth hormone (GH), triiodothyronine (T3), tetraiodothyronine (T4), and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in piglets at day 21 of the experiment were higher when fed diets supplemented with LY and SFY than those in Control group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Compared to Control group, contents of serum urea nitrogen of piglets were reduced by the 3 yeast-supplemented diets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Diets supplemented with LY increased villus height and villus-to-crypt ratio in duodenum and jejunum of piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared to other two groups at day 7 of the experiment. Feeding diets supplemented with LY and SFY increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) serum concentrations of IgA, IL-2, and IL-6 levels in piglets compared to Control. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio and proliferation of T-lymphocytes in piglets fed diets supplemented with LY were increased compared to that of Control group at day 7 of the experiment (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThis experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of increased atmospheric temperature and CO2 concentration during crop growth on the chemical composition and in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics of wheat straw. The field experiment was carried out from November 2012 to June 2013 at Changshu (31°32′93″N, 120°41′88″E) agro-ecological experimental station. A total of three treatments were set. The concentration of CO2 was increased to 500\\xa0μmol/mol in the first treatment (CO2 group). The temperature was increased by 2\\xa0°C in the second treatment (TEM group) and the concentration of CO2 and temperature were both increased in the third treatment (CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM group). The mean temperature and concentration of CO2 in control group were 10.5\\xa0°C and 413\\xa0μmol/mol. At harvesting, the wheat straws were collected and analyzed for chemical composition and in vitro digestibility. Results showed that dry matter was significantly increased in all three treatments. Ether extracts and neutral detergent fiber were significantly increased in TEM and CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM groups. Crude protein was significantly decreased in CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM group. In vitro digestibility analysis of wheat straw revealed that gas production was significantly decreased in CO2 and CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM groups. Methane production was significantly decreased in TEM and CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM groups. Ammonia nitrogen and microbial crude protein were significantly decreased in all three treatments. Total volatile fatty acids were significantly decreased in CO2 and CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM groups. In conclusion, the chemical composition of the wheat straw was affected by temperature and CO2 and the in vitro digestibility of wheat straw was reduced, especially in the combined treatment of temperature and CO2.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractAnimal production depends on nutrient utilization and if done there is an accelerated momentum towards growth with a low cost to feed ratio Public concern over the consumption of pork with antibiotic residues of the animals fed with antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) has paved the way to use other additives like herbs and their products, probiotics, prebiotics etc. Numerous feed additives are in vogue for achieving this target and one such classical example is the usage of organic acids and their salts. Usage of organic acids was in progress for over four decades. Early weaned piglets are (3–4\\xa0weeks age) exposed to stress with a reduced feed intake, little or no weight gain. This post weaning lag period is due to a limited digestive and absorptive capacity due to insufficient production of hydrochloric acid, pancreatic enzymes and sudden changes in feed consistency and intake. Lowering dietary pH by weak organic acids was found to overcome these problems. The main activity of organic acids is associated with a reduction in gastric pH converting the inactive pepsinogen to active pepsin for effective protein hydrolysis. Organic acids are both bacteriostatic and bactericidal. Lactic acid has been reported to reduce gastric pH and delay the multiplication of an enterotoxigenic E. coli. These acids are the intermediary products in Kreb’s cycle and thus act as an energy source preventing the tissue breakdown resulting from gluconeogenesis and lipolysis. Excretion of supplemental minerals and nitrogen are minimized with organic acids as these form complexes with minerals and aids for their bio-availability. Short chain fatty cids like acetic, propionic and n-butyric acid produced by microbial fermentation of dietary fibre in the large intestines may increase the proliferation of epithelial cells and have stimulatory effects on both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic secretions in pigs. Organic acids also enhances apparent total tract digestibility and improves growth performance. It is concluded that organic acids and their salts increase the protein utilization especially in weaner pigs and improves production indices.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCytoplasmic injection of exogenous DNA into zygotes is a promising technique to generate transgenic livestock. However, it is still relatively inefficient and has not yet been demonstrated to work in buffalo. We sought to improve two key technical parameters of the procedure, namely i) how much linear DNA to inject and ii) when to inject it. For this, we introduced a constitutively expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid into buffalo zygotes.ResultsFirst, we found that the proportion of EGFP-expressing blastocysts derived from zygotes injected with 20 or 50\\xa0ng/μL DNA was significantly higher than from those injected with 5\\xa0μg/mL. However, 50\\xa0ng/μL exogenous DNA compromised blastocyst development compared to non-injected IVF controls. Therefore the highest net yield of EGFP-positive blastocysts was achieved at 20\\xa0ng/μL DNA. Second, zygotes injected early (7–8 h post-insemination [hpi]) developed better than those injected at mid (12–13 hpi) or late (18–19 hpi) time points. Blastocysts derived from early injections were also more frequently EGFP-positive. As a consequence, the net yield of EGFP-expressing blastocysts was more than doubled using early vs late injections (16.4\\xa0% vs 7.7\\xa0%). With respect to blastocyst quality, we found no significant difference in cell numbers of EGFP-positive blastocysts vs non-injected blastocysts. Following embryo transfer of six EGFP-positive blastocysts into four recipient animals, two viable buffalo calves were born. Biopsied ear tissues from both buffalo calves were analyzed for transgene presence and expression by Southern blot, PCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy, respectively. This confirmed that both calves were transgenic.ConclusionsOur cytoplasmic injection protocol improved generation of transgenic embryos and resulted in the first transgenic buffalo calves produced by this method.',\n",

The requirement of expensive micromanipulators and skilled expertise is eliminated in this technique, proving it as a major revolution in the field of embryology. During the past years, many modifications have been incorporated in this technique to boost its efficiency. This alternative approach to micromanipulator based traditional cloning (TC) works wonder in generating comparable or even higher birth rates in addition to declining costs drastically and enabling cryopreservation. This technique is not only applicable to intraspecies nuclear transfer but also to interspecies nuclear transfer (iSCNT) thus permitting conservation of endangered species. It also offers unique possibilities for automation of SCNT which aims at production of transgenic animals that can cure certain human diseases by producing therapeutics hence, providing a healthier future for the wellbeing of humans. The present review aims at highlighting certain aspects of HMC including recent advancements in procedure and factors involved in elevating its efficiency besides covering the potentials and pitfalls of this technique.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThis study was conducted to investigate effect of exogenous melatonin on the development of mouse mature oocytes after cryopreservation.ResultsFirst, mouse metaphase II (MII) oocytes were vitrified in the open-pulled straws (OPS). After warming, they were cultured for 1\\xa0h in M2 medium containing melatonin at different concentrations (0, 10−9, 10−7, 10−5, 10−3\\xa0mol/L). Then the oocytes were used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels (fluorescence microscopy), and the developmental potential after parthenogenetic activation. The experimental results showed that the ROS level and cleavage rate in 10−3\\xa0mol/L melatonin group was significantly lower than that in melatonin-free group (control). The GSH levels and blastocyst rates in all melatonin-treated groups were similar to that in control. Based on the above results, we detected the expression of gene Hsp90aa1, Hsf1, Hspa1b, Nrf2 and Bcl-x1 with qRT-PCR in oocytes treated with 10−7, or 10−3\\xa0mol/L melatonin and untreated control. After warming and culture for 1\\xa0h, the oocytes showed higher Hsp90aa1 expression in 10−7\\xa0mol/L melatonin-treated group than in the control (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05); the Hsf1, Hsp90aa1 and Bcl-x1 expression were significantly decreased in 10−3\\xa0mol/L melatonin-treated group when compared to the control. Based on the above results and previous research, we detected the development of vitrified-warmed oocytes treated with either 10−7 or 0\\xa0mol/L melatonin by in vitro fertilization. No difference was observed between them.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the supplementation of melatonin (10−9 to 10−3\\xa0mol/L) in culture medium and incubation for 1\\xa0h did not improve the subsequent developmental potential of vitrified-warmed mouse MII oocytes, even if there were alteration in gene expression.',\n",

However, in pig production, inflammation induced by numerous factors, such as pathogen infection and stresses (e.g., weaning), results in intestinal mucosal injury and dysfunction, and consequently results in poor growth of pigs. Dietary fatty acids not only play critical roles in energy homeostasis and cellular membrane composition, but also exert potent effects on intestinal development, immune function, and inflammatory response. Recent studies support potential therapeutic roles for specific fatty acids (short chain and medium chain fatty acids and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) in intestinal inflammation of pigs. Results of these new lines of work indicate trophic and cytoprotective effects of fatty acids on intestinal integrity in pigs. In this article, we review the effect of inflammation on intestinal structure and function, and the role of specific fatty acids on intestinal health of pigs, especially under inflammatory conditions.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractClays are crystalline, hydrated aluminosilicate molecules composed of alkali and alkaline earth cations along with small amounts of various other elements. The best-known are montmorillonite, smectite, illite, kaolinite, biotite and clinoptilolite. The molecules in these clays are arranged in three-dimensional structures creating internal voids and channels capable of trapping a wide variety of molecules. As a result of this structure, clay minerals are regarded as a simple and effective tool for the prevention of the negative effects of many toxic compounds. Dietary supplementation with clays has been shown to improve weight gain and feed conversion in pigs. Where improvements in performance have been noted, one of the most likely explanations for the improvement is the fact clays increase nutrient digestibility. Clays reduce the speed of passage of feed along the digestive tract which allows more time for digestion. Feeding clays also causes morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa such as an increase in villus height and an increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. These changes increase the surface area of the gastrointestinal tract thus increasing nutrient digestibility. Several studies have indicated that feeding clay reduces the incidence, severity and duration of diarrhea in pigs. The mechanism for the reduction in diarrhea is likely due to increases in the numbers of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus and decreases in Clostridia and E. coli in the small intestine of pigs fed clays. In addition, the numbers of pigs born alive and weaned, birth weight and weaning weight have been shown to be higher for sows fed clays. Several studies have indicated that clays can help mitigate the effects of mycotoxins. The aim of the present review is to focus on the various clays which have been given attention in recent research and to discuss their potential to improve pig performance.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe nutritional value of rapeseed meal may be variable due to the variation of its chemical composition. And a precise understanding of the nutritional value of an ingredient is beneficial for the accurate diet formulation and reduction of feed costs. This study was conducted to determine the chemical composition, digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) content, and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) for growing pigs. Thirteen solvent-extracted double-low rapeseed meal (DLRSM) samples were obtained from the main double-low rapeseed producing areas in China.MethodsThe DE and ME contents of the 13 DLRSM samples were measured in growing pigs (six pigs per DLRSM sample, average initial body weight (BW)\\u2009=\\u200948.3\\xa0kg). The AID and SID of AA of 10 DLRSM samples were determined in 12 crossbred barrows (average initial BW\\u2009=\\u200935.3\\xa0kg) by using two 6\\u2009×\\u20096 Latin square designs. Each Latin square comprised one N-free diet and 5 DLRSM test diets.ResultsThe chemical composition of DLRSM varied among samples, and the coefficient of variation was greater than 10\\xa0% for ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), calcium (Ca), and total glucosinolates. The AA content of DLRSM varied among samples especially for lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met). On a dry matter (DM) basis, the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of gross energy (GE), the DE and ME and the ME:DE ratio of DLRSM averaged 62.39\\xa0%, 2862\\xa0kcal/kg and 2723\\xa0kcal/kg, and 94.95\\xa0%, respectively. The mean value of SID of Lys was 70.52\\xa0% which varied from 66.54–76.54\\xa0%. The SID of crude protein (CP), Met, and threonine (Thr) averaged 72.81\\xa0%, 82.41\\xa0%, and 69.76\\xa0%, respectively.ConclusionsThere was great variability in chemical composition especially in the concentration of EE, NDF and ADF, but no significant differences in energy content of the DLRSM samples were observed. In addition, the AID and SID of all AA were relatively similar among DLRSM samples except for that of Lys.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe protein/energy ratio is important for the production performance and utilization of available feed resources by animals. Increased protein consumption by mammals leads to elevated feed costs and increased nitrogen release into the environment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary protein/energy ratio on the growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and plasma metabolites of pigs of different genotypes.MethodsBama mini-pigs and Landrace pigs were randomly assigned to two dietary treatment groups (Chinese conventional diet with low protein/energy ratio or National Research Council diet with high protein/energy ratio; n\\u2009=\\u200924 per treatment) in a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement. Blood and muscle samples were collected at the end of the nursery, growing, and finishing phases.ResultsWe observed significant interactions (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) between breed and diet for total fat percentage, intramuscular fat (IMF) content, protein content in biceps femoris (BF) muscle, and plasma urea nitrogen (UN) concentration in the nursery phase; for average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), dry matter, IMF content in psoas major (PM) muscle, and plasma total protein and albumin concentrations in the growing phase; and for drip loss and plasma UN concentration in the finishing phase. Breed influenced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality, but not plasma metabolites. Throughout the trial, Landrace pigs showed significantly higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) ADG, ADFI, dressing percentage, lean mass rate, and loin-eye area than did Bama mini-pigs, but significantly lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) feed/gain ratio, fat percentage, backfat thickness, and IMF content. Dietary protein/energy ratio influenced the pH value, chemical composition of BF and PM muscles, and plasma activities of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and plasma concentration of UN.ConclusionsCompared with Landrace pigs, Bama mini-pigs showed slower growth and lower carcass performance, but had better meat quality. Moreover, unlike Landrace pigs, the dietary protein/energy ratio did not affect the growth performance of Bama mini-pigs. These results suggest that, in swine production, low dietary protein/energy ratio may be useful for reducing feed costs and minimizing the adverse effects of ammonia release into the environment.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractLysozyme is a naturally occurring enzyme found in bodily secretions such as tears, saliva, and milk. It functions as an antimicrobial agent by cleaving the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls, which leads to cell death. Antibiotics are also antimicrobials and have been fed at subtherapeutic levels to swine as growth promoters. These compounds benefit swine producers by minimizing production losses by increasing feed efficiency and decreasing susceptibility to bacterial infection and disease. This manuscript reviews the knowledge of the effects of lysozyme, as compared to traditional subtherapeutic antibiotics in swine feed, on pig performance and health. It is clear from decades of studies that antibiotic use in feeds increases pig performance, particularly in the nursery. Similarly, lysozyme, as a feed additive, increases growth and feed efficiency. While the mechanism by which antibiotics and lysozyme improve performance is not clearly understood, both of these feed additives improve gastrointestinal health, improve the metabolic profile, and alter the gastrointestinal bacteria ecology of swine. Therefore, lysozyme is a suitable alternative to growth-promoting subtherapeutic antibiotic use in swine feed.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractFeed efficiency represents the cumulative efficiency with which the pig utilizes dietary nutrients for maintenance, lean gain and lipid accretion. It is closely linked with energy metabolism, as the oxidation of carbon-containing components in the feed drive all metabolic processes. While much is known about nutrient utilization and tissue metabolism, blending these subjects into a discussion on feed efficiency has proven to be difficult. For example, while increasing dietary energy concentration will almost certainly increase feed efficiency, the correlation between dietary energy concentration and feed efficiency is surprisingly low. This is likely due to the plethora of non-dietary factors that impact feed efficiency, such as the environment and health as well as individual variation in maintenance requirements, body composition and body weight.Nonetheless, a deeper understanding of feed efficiency is critical at many levels. To individual farms, it impacts profitability. To the pork industry, it represents its competitive position against other protein sources. To food economists, it means less demand on global feed resources. There are environmental and other societal implications as well.Interestingly, feed efficiency is not always reported simply as a ratio of body weight gain to feed consumed. This review will explain why this arithmetic calculation, as simple as it initially seems, and as universally applied as it is in science and commerce, can often be misleading due to errors inherent in recording of both weight gain and feed intake.This review discusses the importance of feed efficiency, the manner in which it can be measured and reported, its basis in biology and approaches to its improvement. It concludes with a summary of findings and recommendations for future efforts.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCortisol is secreted into blood in reaction to acute stress, but also in phases of diminished feed intake and changed animal behavior. As cows do not always show clear signs of discomfort, reliable diagnostic markers could be used to provide information regarding individual cows’ distress. The objective of this study was to establish an ether free immunoassay for the detection of cortisol and to determine values during the first 22 weeks of lactation. Furthermore, the response in milk cortisol levels was assessed during times of metabolic stress and pain associated symptoms of lameness.MethodsMilk yield and composition, blood serum glucose, NEFA and BHBA as well as milk cortisol were determined in 24 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows over the course of the first 22 weeks of lactation. Animals were further checked for signs of clinical diseases on a daily basis. Two feed restrictions over three days (FR; 70\\xa0% of precious ad libitum intake) were performed during the 4th wk and the 21st wk, respectively. An ELISA for cortisol measurement in easily accessible bovine skimmed milk was established and applied.ResultsOn the last day of FR in early lactation, a reduction in milk yield and changes in serum metabolites compared to respective previous values were detected. The FR in mid-lactation resulted in no changes in milk production and serum metabolites. Milk cortisol was highest during first wk of lactation and remained on comparable levels thereafter. Milk yield and composition were not influenced by FR. Lameness resulted in enhanced milk cortisol levels.ConclusionMilk cortisol could be used as an indicator of painful symptoms such as lameness. Higher values of milk cortisol levels during first wk of lactation should be taken into account for interpretation.',\n",

Because lipids are a concentrated energy source, inclusion of lipids are known to affect growth rate and feed efficiency, but are also known to affect diet palatability, feed dustiness, and pellet quality. In reviewing the literature, the majority of research studies conducted on the subject of lipids have focused mainly on the effects of feeding presumably high quality lipids on growth performance, digestion, and metabolism in young animals. There is, however, the wide array of composition and quality differences among lipid sources available to the animal industry making it essential to understand differences in lipid composition and quality factors affecting their digestion and metabolism more fully. In addition there is often confusion in lipid nomenclature, measuring lipid content and composition, and evaluating quality factors necessary to understand the true feeding value to animals. Lastly, advances in understanding lipid digestion, post-absorption metabolism, and physiological processes (e.g., cell division and differentiation, immune function and inflammation); and in metabolic oxidative stress in the animal and lipid peroxidation, necessitates a more compressive assessment of factors affecting the value of lipid supplementation to livestock diets. The following review provides insight into lipid classification, digestion and absorption, lipid peroxidation indices, lipid quality and nutritional value, and antioxidants in growing pigs.',\n",

Considering the fact that developing chick embryo spends over 30\\xa0% of its total life span inside the hatching egg relying on nutrients deposited by the breeder hen, investigations on nutritional needs during pre-hatch period will improve embryonic health, hatchability and chick viability. In this context, investigations on hatching egg lipid quality is of utmost importance because, during incubation, egg fat is the major source of energy and sole source of essential omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids to the chick embryo.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractSince 1950, links between intake of saturated fatty acids and heart disease have led to recommendations to limit consumption of saturated fatty acid-rich foods, including beef. Over this time, changes in food consumption patterns in several countries including Canada and the USA have not led to improvements in health. Instead, the incidence of obesity, type II diabetes and associated diseases have reached epidemic proportions owing in part to replacement of dietary fat with refined carbohydrates. Despite the content of saturated fatty acids in beef, it is also rich in heart healthy cis-monounsaturated fatty acids, and can be an important source of long-chain omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in populations where little or no oily fish is consumed. Beef also contains polyunsaturated fatty acid biohydrogenation products, including vaccenic and rumenic acids, which have been shown to have anticarcinogenic and hypolipidemic properties in cell culture and animal models. Beef can be enriched with these beneficial fatty acids through manipulation of beef cattle diets, which is now more important than ever because of increasing public understanding of the relationships between diet and health. The present review examines recommendations for beef in human diets, the need to recognize the complex nature of beef fat, how cattle diets and management can alter the fatty acid composition of beef, and to what extent content claims are currently possible for beef fatty acids.',\n",

The milk fatty acid profile of dairy cows is low in polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially those of the n-3 series. Efforts to change and influence fatty acid profile with longer chain polyunsaturated fatty acids have proven challenging. Several barriers prevent easy transfer of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids to milk fat including rumen biohydrogenation and fatty acid esterification. The potential for cellular uptake and differences in fatty acid incorporation into milk fat might also have an effect, though this has received less research effort.

Nine trials, divided into three classes (technological, environmental and biological factors) were conducted to illustrate the influence of these factors on body surface temperature assessed through infrared imaging.ResultsEvaluation of technological factors indicated the following: measurements of body temperatures were strongly repeatable when taken within 10\\xa0s; appropriateness of differing infrared camera technologies was influenced by distance to the target; and results were consistent when analysis of thermographs was compared between judges. Evaluation of environmental factors illustrated that wind and debris caused decreases in body surface temperatures without affecting metabolic rate; additionally, body surface temperature increased due to sunlight but returned to baseline values within minutes of shade exposure. Examination/investigation/exploration of animal factors demonstrated that exercise caused an increase in body surface temperature and metabolic rate. Administration of sedative and anti-sedative caused changes on body surface temperature and metabolic rate, and during late pregnancy a foetal thermal imprint was visible through abdominal infrared imaging.ConclusionThe above factors should be considered in order to standardize operational procedures for taking thermographs, thereby optimizing the use of such technology in cattle operations.',\n",

This may be due to more rumen escape protein and less excreted N in the urine with the 15\\xa0% PB diet.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractKisspeptin (Kp) is synthesized in the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area of the hypothalamus and is a regulator of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the hypothalamus. In addition, Kp may regulate additional functions such as increased neuropeptide Y gene expression and reduced proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in sheep. Other studies have found a role for Kp to release growth hormone (GH), prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH) from cattle, rat and monkey pituitary cells. Intravenous injection of Kp stimulated release LH, GH, prolactin and follicle stimulating hormone in some experiments in cattle and sheep, but other studies have failed to find an effect of peripheral injection of Kp on GH release. Recent studies indicate that Kp can stimulate GH release after intracerebroventricular injection in sheep at doses that do not release GH after intravenous injection. These studies suggest that Kp may have a role in regulation of both reproduction and metabolism in sheep. Since GH plays a role in luteal development, it is tempting to speculate that the ability of Kp to release GH and LH is related to normal control of reproduction.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundExogenous melatonin could induce cashmere growth. However, induced growth of cashmere fleece by melatonin implants cannot be combined with the typical growth, resulting in earlier shedding followed by another cycle of cashmere growth. To address this issue, we examine the effects on the cashmere yield, fibre characteristics, and the growth and reproductive performance of cashmere goats of planned administration of melatonin.MethodsEighteen half-sib, female goats were assigned to two treatments (n\\u2009=\\u20099) including a control and a treatment where melatonin (2\\xa0mg/kg BW) was implanted at the end of April and end of June. Cashmere growth and shedding were observed for approximately 1\\xa0year following implantation. Fibre samples were collected monthly to determine cumulative cashmere length. Initiation and cessation dates for cashmere growth as well as the rate of cashmere growth were calculated. Cashmere yield, weight gain of dam, kidding date, litter size, and birth weight were also recorded.ResultsMelatonin implantation increased cashmere yield by 34.5\\xa0% (control 553.7\\xa0g vs. melatonin 745.0\\xa0g; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), cashmere length by 21.3\\xa0% (control 95.2\\xa0mm vs. melatonin 115.4\\xa0mm; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), and decreased fibre diameter by 4.4\\xa0% (control 14.6\\xa0μm vs. melatonin 14.0\\xa0μm; P\\u2009<\\u20090.03). In melatonin-treated goats, the average initiation date was earlier than in control goats (May 18, 2013 vs. July 2, 2013; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) but there was a similar cessation date (March 22, 2014 vs. March 27, 2014). Consequently, the duration of cashmere growth was longer in melatonin-treated goats than in control goats (307 vs.270\\xa0days; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The final BW, average daily gain, kidding date, litter size, and birth weight were not influenced by melatonin implantation.ConclusionsThese data indicate that melatonin implantation (2\\xa0mg/kg BW) on two occasions (late April and June) increased cashmere yield by combining the induced growth of cashmere fleece with the typical growth and decreased the fibre diameter without changing dam growth rate or reproductive performance.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIMP (inosine 5′-monophosphate) is a compound that enhances the flavor of poultry meat. IMP has become a new breeding trait to improve poultry meat quality. We tried to identify several potential regulatory genes, and construct their predicted regulatory relationships. Time series gene expression profiles of thigh muscle tissues of Rugao chicken, a famous indigenous breed in China, were performed for analysis of genes that are co-expressed or correlated with the concentration of IMP. We found 15 crucial co-expression genes, which are Hspa2, Pten, Gabpa, Bpi, Mkl1, Srf, Cd34, Hspa4, Etv6, Bmpr2, Gde1, Igfbp5, Cd28, Pecam1 and Gja1, that may directly or indirectly regulate IMP metabolism. Eventually, we computed the correlation coefficient between 19 IMP Genes and 15 CGs (15 co-expression genes), and we identified and constructed a predicted regulation network. In conclusion, variation of IMP concentration was primarily connected with the muscle development process. During this process, 15 CGs were identified that may have significant influence on IMP metabolism. In particular, Bmpr2, Pten and co-expression genes correlated with Entpd8 might play important roles in regulating IMP de novo synthesis, decomposition and salvage synthesis.',\n",

Surviving birds showed lower feed utilization, growth performance or egg production, which results in severe economic losses. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different doses of NDV immunization on growth performance, plasma variables and immune response of broiler chickens.MethodsA total of 480 one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly administrated with 0, 4, 6 or 8 doses of NDV at 12 d and 28 d, respectively. Each group consisted of ten replicates with 12 birds each. Growth performance and organ weight were recorded. Plasma concentration of glucose, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acid was determined using commercial kits. The concentration of plasma corticosterone and insulin was measured using commercially available radio immune assay kits. Serum antibody titer and peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation were also recorded.ResultsThe results showed that NDV decreased body weight gain (BWG), and increased Feed:Gain ratio at 1–21 d at all doses (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Plasma insulin concentration was lower in all immunization groups after the first immunization at 12\\xa0d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The rest of the plasma indexes were not affected by NDV immunization, including glucose, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acid, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, as well as the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocyte (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Compared with the control group, NDV treatment elevated NDV antibody titer at 10\\xa0d after the first inoculation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and at d 5, 9 and 13 after the second inoculation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Repeated NDV inoculation had no deleterious impacts on body composition at 42\\xa0d, and nutrient accretion rates at 8–42 d (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05).ConclusionsIn conclusion, NDV challenge decreased BWG and feed efficiency in earlier stage of growth. However, NDV treatment at 6 doses down-regulated the Feed:Gain ratio by 6.36\\xa0% throughout the whole growing period. These data suggest that appropriate lower doses of NDV inoculation increase feed efficiency of broiler chickens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundEarly pregnancy failure has a profound impact on both human reproductive health and animal production. 2/3 pregnancy failures occur during the peri-implantation period; however, the underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. Well-organized modification of the endometrium to a receptive state is critical to establish pregnancy. Aberrant endometrial modification during implantation is thought to be largely responsible for early pregnancy loss.ResultIn this study, using well-managed recipient ewes that received embryo transfer as model, we compared the endometrial proteome between pregnant and non-pregnant ewes during implantation period. After embryo transfer, recipients were assigned as pregnant or non-pregnant ewes according to the presence or absence of an elongated conceptus at Day 17 of pregnancy. By comparing the endometrial proteomic profiles between pregnant and non-pregnant ewes, we identified 94 and 257 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the endometrial caruncular and intercaruncular areas, respectively. Functional analysis showed that the DEPs were mainly associated with immune response, nutrient transport and utilization, as well as proteasome-mediated proteolysis.ConclusionThese analysis imply that dysfunction of these biological processes or pathways of DEP in the endometrium is highly associated with early pregnancy loss. In addition, many proteins that are essential for the establishment of pregnancy showed dysregulation in the endometrium of non-pregnant ewes. These proteins, as potential candidates, may contribute to early pregnancy loss.',\n",

The product was composed of a 60:40 corn-soybean blend, which was then extruded. This product containing the co-extruded 60:40 corn-soybean blend was commercially developed and is used extensively in swine diets in southwest Minnesota. GE of dietary treatments were determined by isoperibol bomb calorimetry. Twelve barrows (59.9 ± 1.4 kg), were used to determine the digestible and metabolizable energy of the extruded product. DE of treatments was determined by subtracting fecal energy from GE provided to barrows by each respective treatment. ME was determined by subtracting urinary energy from calculated digestible energy. Sixty-three sows were used for the lactation trial. Three dietary treatments were utilized: CONTROL (an industry standard diet); PRODUCT (contained the product, vitamins and minerals); OIL (matched the lysine:ME ratio of PRODUCT by addition of soy oil). Sow weight, backfat thickness at the right and left last ribs, body condition score, number of piglets, and litter weights were recorded on the date of farrowing (d 0), (d 9), and at weaning. Blood and milk samples were obtained at weaning, and blood was analyzed for plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), milk was analyzed for total protein and fat content.ResultsOn a dry-matter basis, the test diet provided 3,908 kcal/kg DE and 3,833 kcal/kg ME, which was significantly greater than the basal diet, which provided 3,633 kcal/kg DE and 3,567 kcal/kg ME (P < 0.0001). These data were used to establish the DE and ME of the product, which were 3,882 kcal/kg and 3,798 kcal/kg, respectively, on an as-fed basis. No effect of diet was observed for changes in sow backfat (RBF P = 0.24; LBF P = 0.07) or body condition score (P = 0.12) during lactation. Milk total protein (P = 0.69), fat (P = 0.66), PUN, average piglet gain (P = 0.55) and piglet mortality (P = 0.70) did not differ between treatments.ConclusionsWhile the novel extruded product was higher in energy content than traditional feedstuffs, it resulted in the same lactational sow performance. Thus, the co-extruded corn-soybean product is a reasonable inclusion in sow lactation diets.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractInadequate delivery of nutrients results in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in livestock. In ruminants, inadequate nutrition during pregnancy is often prevalent due to frequent utilization of exensive forage based grazing systems, making them highly susceptible to changes in nutrient quality and availability. Delivery of nutrients to the fetus is dependent on a number of critical factors including placental growth and development, utero-placental blood flow, nutrient availability, and placental metabolism and transport capacity. Previous findings from our laboratory and others, highlight essential roles for amino acids and their metabolites in supporting normal fetal growth and development, as well as the critical role for amino acid transporters in nutrient delivery to the fetus. The focus of this review will be on the role of maternal nutrition on placental form and function as a regulator of fetal development in ruminants.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractKnowledge about the amino acid requirements and the response of pigs to the amino acid supply is essential in feed formulation. A deficient AA supply results in a reduction in performance while an oversupply is costly and leads to excessive nitrogen excretion with a potentially negative environmental impact. Amino acid requirements are determined to a large extent by the protein deposition in the body and, for lactating sows, by the protein exported in the milk. The concept of ideal protein was developed more than 50\\xa0years ago and refers to a protein with an amino acid profile that exactly meets the animal’s requirement so that all amino acids are equally limiting for performance. Because Lys typically is the first-limiting amino acid, the ideal amino acid profile is often expressed relative to Lys. Although the ideal protein profile is often assumed to be constant for a given production stage, (small) changes in the ideal protein profile can occur within a production stage. This can be caused by changes in the relative contribution of the different components of amino acid requirements during the productive life on the animal (e.g. changes in the relative contribution of growth and maintenance). Amino acids requirements can be determined experimentally using dose–response studies. The design of the study, the chosen response criterion, and the statistical model affect the requirement estimate. Although considerable experimental work has been carried out to determine the requirements for Lys, Met, Thr, and Trp in growing pigs (and to a lesser extent in sows), little is known about the requirements for the other essential amino acids. Experimental dose–response studies generally focus on the requirement and less on the overall response (i.e. what are the consequences of an amino acid deficiency?). This latter aspect is, to some extent, accounted for in modelling approaches that quantify the response of the animal to the amino acid supply in a dynamic way. The paper describes the origin of ideal protein and illustrates how fundamental concepts of amino acid nutrition have been integrated in practical modeling approaches for the nutrition of growing pigs and sows.',\n",

The bacterial strains most frequently used as probiotic agents are lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus reuteri, which is one of the few endogenous Lactobacillus species found in the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates, including humans, rats, pigs and chickens. L. reuteri is one of the most well documented probiotic species and has been widely utilized as a probiotic in humans and animals for many years. Initially, L. reuteri was used in humans to reduce the incidence and the severity of diarrhea, prevent colic and necrotic enterocolitis, and maintain a functional mucosal barrier. As interest in alternatives to in-feed antibiotics has grown in recent years, some evidence has emerged that probiotics may promote growth, improve the efficiency of feed utilization, prevent diarrhea, and regulate the immune system in pigs. In this review, the characteristics of L. reuteri are described, in order to update the evidence on the efficacy of using L. reuteri in pigs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundRapeseed cake is a good source of protein for animal feed but its utilization is limited due to the presence of anti-nutritional substances, such as glucosinolates (Gls), phytic acid, tannins etc. In the present study, a solid state fermentation (SSF) using Aspergillus niger was carried out with the purpose of degrading glucosinolates and improving the nutritional quality of rapeseed cake (RSC). The effects of medium composition and incubation conditions on the Gls content in fermented rapeseed cake (FRSC) were investigated, and chemical composition and amino acid in vitro digestibility of RSC substrate fermented under optimal conditions were determined.ResultsAfter 72\\xa0h of incubation at 34°C, a 76.89% decrease in Gls of RSC was obtained in solid medium containing 70% RSC, 30% wheat bran at optimal moisture content 60% (w/w). Compared to unfermented RSC, trichloroacetic acid soluble protein (TCA-SP), crude protein and ether extract contents of the FRSC were increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) 103.71, 23.02 and 23.54%, respectively. As expected, the contents of NDF and phytic acid declined (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by 9.12 and 44.60%, respectively. Total amino acids (TAA) and essential amino acids (EAA) contents as well as AA in vitro digestibility of FRSC were improved significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Moreover, the enzyme activity of endoglucanase, xylanase, acid protease and phytase were increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) during SSF.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the solid state fermentation offers an effective approach to improving the quality of proteins sources such as rapeseed cake.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundPrevious studies with broiler have shown dietary supplementation with multi-enzyme complex containing non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) degrading enzymes and phytase is efficient in releasing phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), energy and amino acids from corn-soybean meal diets or corn-sorghum diets, hence compensating considerable levels of nutrients in formulation. Notwithstanding, such potentials have not been well defined in duck nutrition. Giving China being the largest duck producing country, we conducted this study to establish adequate specifications of major nutrients along with multi-enzyme complex to meat duck from day-old to slaughter, focusing on performance, utilization of nutrients and bone mineralization. Five dietary treatments were: Positive control (PC,T1 ): the nutrients concentration of diet for 1 to 14 d of age were apparent metabolizable energy(AME) 2,800 kcal/kg, crude protein (CP)19.39%, Ca 0.85%, available phosphorus (avP) 0.42%; for 15 to 35 d of age these parameters were AME 2,900 kcal/kg, CP 16.47%,Ca 0.76%,avP 0.38%; Negative control 1(NC1,T2), the AME and digestible amino acids (DAA) were reduced by 70 kcal/kg and 2.0%, avP and Ca by 1.0 g/kg from PC diet; Negative control 2( NC2,T4), the down-spec from PC diet was AME 100 kcal/kg, DAA 2.5%, avP 1.5 g/kg and Ca 1.2 g/kg; The enzyme complex was added at the same dosage (200 mL/ 1,000 kg) on NC1 (T3) and NC2 (T5) diets.ResultsComparing with the ducks fed on T1, T3 and T5 diets, the birds fed on NC2 diet showed the lowest (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) body weight ( d 14 and 35), feed intake (d 35), tibia ash, Ca and P contents (d 14 and 35), and the utilization of nutrients (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The supplementation with the enzyme complex to the NC diets restored growth rate, utilization of nutrients and bone mineralization to the level of the PC diet, and increased AME by 60 kcal/kg and 117 kcal/kg, respectively for the NC1 and NC2 diets.ConclusionThese results suggest that down-spec AME by 100 kcal/kg, DAA by 2.5%, avP by 1.5 g/kg and Ca by 1.2 g/kg caused detrimental effects on duck performance compared with those fed on the PC diet, and these performance losses can be compensated by the addition of the multiple-enzyme complex.',\n",

Each group of pigs (n = 10) was delivered from pregnant sows fed a commercial diet with or without 0.8% clofibrate for the last 7 d of gestation. Blood samples were collected from the utero-ovarian artery of the sows and the umbilical cords of the pigs as they were removed from the sows by C-section on day 113 of gestation.ResultsHPLC analysis identified that clofibric acid was present in the plasma of the clofibrate-fed sow (~4.2 μg/mL) and its offspring (~1.5 μg/mL). Furthermore, the maternal-fed clofibrate had no impact on the liver weight of the pigs at 0 h and 24 h, but hepatic fatty acid oxidation examined in fresh homogenates showed that clofibrate increased (P < 0.01) 14C-accumulation in CO2 and acid soluble products 2.9-fold from [1-14C]-oleic acid and 1.6-fold from [1-14C]-lignoceric acid respectively. Correspondingly, clofibrate increased fetal hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) activities by 36% and 42% over controls (P < 0.036). The mRNA abundance of CPT I was 20-fold higher in pigs exposed to clofibrate (P < 0.0001) but no differences were detected for ACO and PPARα mRNA between the two groups.ConclusionThese data demonstrate that dietary clofibrate is absorbed by the sow, crosses the placental membrane, and enters fetal circulation to induce hepatic fatty acid oxidation by increasing the CPT and ACO activities of the newborn.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractFeed fats and oils provide significant amounts of energy to swine diets, but there is large variation in composition, quality, feeding value, and price among sources. Common measures of lipid quality include moisture, insolubles, and unsaponifiables (MIU), titer, and free fatty acid content, but provide limited information regarding their feeding value. Lipid peroxidation is an important quality factor related to animal growth performance and health, but maximum tolerable limits in various lipids have not been established. Several indicative assays can be used to detect the presence of various peroxidation compounds, but due to the complexity and numerous compounds produced and degraded during peroxidation process, no single method can adequately determine the extent of peroxidation. Until further information is available, using a combination of peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and anisidine value appear to provide a reasonable assessment of the extent of peroxidation in a lipid at a reasonable cost. However, fatty acid composition of the lipid being evaluated should be considered when selecting specific assays. Predictive tests can also be used to estimate the stability or susceptibility of lipids to peroxidation and include active oxygen method, oil stability index, and oxygen bomb method. A review of 16 published studies with pigs has shown an average decrease of 11.4% in growth rate, 8.8% feed intake fed isocaloric diets containing peroxidized lipids compared to diets containing unperoxidized lipids of the same source. Furthermore, serum vitamin E content was generally reduced and serum TBARS content was increased when peroxidized lipids were fed in these studies, suggesting that feeding peroxidized lipids negatively affects metabolic oxidative status of pigs. However, it is unclear if antioxidants are useful additions to lipids to maintain optimal nutritional value, or if their addition to swine diets is beneficial in overcoming a metabolic oxidative challenge.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundMetabolic profile was initially designed as a presymptomatic diagnostic aid based on statistical analyses of blood metabolites to provide an early warning of certain types of metabolic disorder. However, there is little metabolic profile data available about Korean Hanwoo cows. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the reference intervals of metabolic profile for Korean Hanwoo cows.MethodsHealthy animals (2,205) were selected and divided into early (day 1 to 95), middle (day 96 to 190) and late (day 191 to 285) period according to their gestating period. Metabolic profile including total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), urea (UREA), glucose (Glu), total cholesterol (T-Cho), long-chain fatty acid (LCFA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatinine (Crea), calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphorous (iP) and magnesium (Mg) were analyzed using a TBA-40FR automatic biochemical analyzer. The data of Korean Hanwoo cows were then compared to those of the Japanese Wagyu cows.ResultsMost of the data of the Korean Hanwoo cows were relatively higher than those of Japanese Wagyu cows, with the exception of Glu and GGT. This may indicate that the nutritional level of feed for the Korean Hanwoo cows was higher than that of the Japanese Wagyu cows because of the different feeding system. In particular, relatively higher levels of UREA and LCFA were observed in the Korean Hanwoo cows, and this may also contribute to the low reproduction efficiency.ConclusionsThese findings may provide some theoretical basis for understanding the reproductive and feeding situation of Korean Hanwoo cows.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThis paper summarizes the current knowledge regarding the possible modes of action and nutritional factors involved in the use of essential oils (EOs) for swine and poultry. EOs have recently attracted increased interest as feed additives to be fed to swine and poultry, possibly replacing the use of antibiotic growth promoters which have been prohibited in the European Union since 2006. In general, EOs enhance the production of digestive secretions and nutrient absorption, reduce pathogenic stress in the gut, exert antioxidant properties and reinforce the animal’s immune status, which help to explain the enhanced performance observed in swine and poultry. However, the mechanisms involved in causing this growth promotion are far from being elucidated, since data on the complex gut ecosystem, gut function, in vivo oxidative status and immune system are still lacking. In addition, limited information is available regarding the interaction between EOs and feed ingredients or other feed additives (especially pro- or prebiotics and organic acids). This knowledge may help feed formulators to better utilize EOs when they formulate diets for poultry and swine.',\n",

To address this issue, we systematically analyzed chicken hypothalamus transcriptome responses to thermal stress using a 44 k chicken Agilent microarray,MethodsHypothalamus samples were collected from a control group reared at 25°C, a heat-stress group treated at 34°C for 24 h, and a temperature-recovery group reared at 25°C for 24 h following a heat-stress treatment. We compared the expression profiles between each pair of the three groups using microarray data.ResultsA total of 1,967 probe sets were found to be differentially expressed in the three comparisons with P < 0.05 and a fold change (FC) higher than 1.5, and the genes were mainly involved in self-regulation and compensation required to maintain homeostasis. Consistent expression results were found for 11 selected genes by quantitative real-time PCR. Thirty-eight interesting differential expression genes were found from GO term annotation and those genes were related to meat quality, growth, and crucial enzymes. Using these genes for genetic network analysis, we obtained three genetic networks. Moreover, the transcripts of heat-shock protein, including Hsp 40 and Hsp 90, were significantly altered in response to thermal stress.ConclusionsThis study provides a broader understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying stress response in chickens and discovery of novel genes that are regulated in a specific thermal-stress manner.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe filamentous fungus Talaromyces versatilis is known to improve the metabolizable energy of wheat-based poultry diets thanks to its ability to produce a pool of CAZymes and particularly endo-β(1,4)-xylanases. In order to appreciate their in vivo mode of action, the supplementation effect of two of its xylanases, XynD and XynB from families GH10 and GH11 respectively, have been evaluated on two different wheat cultivars Caphorn and Isengrain, which were chosen amongst 6 varieties for their difference in non starch polysaccharides content and arabinoxylan composition.ResultsPolysaccharides digestion was followed during 6\\xa0h along the digestive tract using the TNO gastrointestinal model-1, to mimic monogastric metabolism. Polysaccharide degradation appeared to occur mainly at the jejunal level and was higher with Isengrain than with Caphorn. For both cultivars, XynD and XynB supplementation increased notably the amount of reducing end sugars into the jejuno-ileal dialysates, which has been confirmed by a valuable increase of the soluble glucose into the jejunal dialysates.ConclusionsThe amounts of arabinose and xylose into the dialysates and ileal deliveries increased consequently mainly for Caphorn, suggesting that XynD and XynB supplementation in wheat-based diet could alleviate the anti-nutritional effects of arabinoxylans by limiting the physical entrapment of starch and could increase the available metabolizable energy.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMany advances in genetic selection, nutrition, housing and disease control have been incorporated into modern pork production since the 1950s resulting in highly prolific females and practices and technologies, which significantly increased efficiency of reproduction in the breeding herd. The objective of this manuscript is to review the literature and current industry practices employed for reproductive management. In particular the authors focus on assisted reproduction technologies and their application for enhanced productivity. Modern maternal line genotypes have lower appetites and exceptional lean growth potential compared to females of 20\\xa0yr ago. Thus, nutrient requirements and management techniques and technologies, which affect gilt development and sow longevity, require continuous updating. Failure to detect estrus accurately has the greatest impact on farrowing rate and litter size. Yet, even accurate estrus detection will not compensate for the variability in the interval between onset of estrus and actual time of ovulation. However, administration of GnRH analogs in weaned sows and in gilts after withdrawal of altrenogest do overcome this variability and thereby synchronize ovulation, which makes fixed-time AI practical. Seasonal infertility, mediated by temperature and photoperiod, is a persistent problem. Training workers in the art of stockmanship is of increasing importance as consumers become more interested in humane animal care. Altrenogest, is used to synchronize the estrous cycle of gilts, to prolong gestation for 2–3 d to synchronize farrowing and to postpone post-weaning estrus. P.G. 600® is used for induction of estrus in pre-pubertal gilts and as a treatment to overcome seasonal anestrous. Sperm cell numbers/dose of semen is significantly less for post cervical AI than for cervical AI. Real-time ultrasonography is used to determine pregnancy during wk 3–5. PGF2α effectively induces farrowing when administered within two d of normal gestation length. Ovulation synchronization, single fixed-time AI and induced parturition may lead to farrowing synchronization, which facilitates supervision and reduces stillbirths and piglet mortality. Attendance and assistance at farrowing is important especially to ensure adequate colostrum consumption by piglets immediately after birth. New performance terminologies are presented.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractFermented liquid feed is feed that has been mixed with water at a ratio ranging from 1:1.5 to 1:4. By mixing with water, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts naturally occurring in the feed proliferate and produce lactic acid, acetic acid and ethanol which reduces the pH of the mixture. This reduction in pH inhibits pathogenic organisms from developing in the feed. In addition, when this low pH mixture is fed, it reduces the pH in the stomach of pigs and prevents the proliferation of pathogens such as coliforms and Salmonella in the gastrointestinal tract. For piglets, the use of fermented liquid feed offers the possibility of simultaneously providing feed and water, which may facilitate an easier transition from sow’s milk to solid feed. Secondly, offering properly produced fermented liquid feed may strengthen the role of the stomach as the first line of defense against possible pathogenic infections by lowering the pH in the gastrointestinal tract thereby helping to exclude enteropathogens. Finally, feeding fermented liquid feed to pigs has been shown to improve the performance of suckling pigs, weaner pigs and growing-finishing pigs. In this review, current knowledge about the use of fermented liquid feed in pig diets will be discussed. This will include a discussion of the desirable properties of fermented liquid feed and factors affecting fermentation. In addition, advantages and disadvantages of fermented liquid feed will be discussed including its effects on gastrointestinal health, intestinal pH and the types of bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract as well as the effects of fermented liquid feeds on pig performance.',\n",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated and characterized from various species, but are poorly characterized in goats.ResultsGoat MSCs isolated from bone marrow (BM-MSCs) and adipose tissue (ASCs) have the ability to undergo osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. Cytochemical staining and gene expression analysis show that ASCs have a greater capacity for adipogenic differentiation compared to BM-MSCs and fibroblasts. Different methods of inducing adipogenesis also affect the extent and profile of adipogenic differentiation in MSCs. Goat fibroblasts were not capable of osteogenesis, hence distinguishing them from the MSCs. Goat MSCs and fibroblasts express CD90, CD105, CD73 but not CD45, and exhibit cytoplasmic localization of OCT4 protein. Goat MSCs can be stably transfected by Nucleofection, but, as evidenced by colony-forming efficiency (CFE), yield significantly different levels of progenitor cells that are robust enough to proliferate into colonies of integrants following G418 selection. BM-MSCs expanded over increasing passages in vitro maintained karyotypic stability up to 20 passages in culture, exhibited an increase in adipogenic differentiation and CFE, but showed altered morphology and amenability to genetic modification by selection.ConclusionsOur findings provide characterization information on goat MSCs, and show that there can be significant differences between MSCs isolated from different tissues and from within the same tissue. Fibroblasts do not exhibit trilineage differentiation potential at the same capacity as MSCs, making it a more reliable method for distinguishing MSCs from fibroblasts, compared to cell surface marker expression.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundLimited availability of fish meal and whey protein concentrate increases overall feed costs. Availability of increased number of supplemental amino acids including Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, Val, and Ile allows replacing expensive protein supplements to reduce feed costs. This study was to evaluate the effect of replacing fish meal and/or whey protein concentrate in nursery diets with 6 supplemental amino acids on growth performance and gut health of post-weaning pigs. Treatments were 1) FM-WPC: diet with fish meal (FM) and whey protein concentrate (WPC); 2) FM-AA: diet with FM and crystalline amino acids (L-Lys, L-Thr, L-Trp, DL-Met, L-Val, and L-Ile); 3) WPC-AA: diet with WPC and crystalline amino acid; and 4) AA: diet with crystalline amino acid.ResultsPigs in FM-AA, WPC-AA, and AA had greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) ADG and gain:feed than pigs in FM-WPC during wk 1 (phase 1). Plasma insulin concentration of pigs in AA tended to be greater (P\\u2009=\\u20090.064) than that of FM-WPC at the end of wk 1(phase 1). Plasma concentrations of IgG in AA was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared with WPC-AA and FW, and FM-AA had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) IgG concentration than WPC-AA at the end of wk 1 (phase 1). Concentration of acetate in cecum digesta in FM-AA tended to be greater (P\\u2009=\\u20090.054) than that of FM-WPC and WPC-AA. Concentration of isovalerate in cecum digesta of pigs in FM-AA was greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than that of FW and WPC-AA.ConclusionsThis study indicates that use of 6 supplemental amino acids can replace fish meal and/or whey protein concentrate without adverse effects on growth performance, immune status, and gut health of pigs at d 21 to 49 of age. Positive response with the use of 6 supplemental amino acids in growth during the first week of post-weaning may due to increased plasma insulin potentially improving uptake of nutrients for protein synthesis and energy utilization. The replacement of fish meal and/or whey protein concentrate with 6 supplemental amino acids could decrease the crude protein level in nursery diets, and potentially lead to substantial cost savings in expensive nursery diets.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractOsteopontin (OPN; also known as Secreted Phosphoprotein 1, SPP1) is a secreted extra-cellular matrix (ECM) protein that binds to a variety of cell surface integrins to stimulate cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion and communication. It is generally accepted that OPN interacts with apically expressed integrin receptors on the uterine luminal epithelium (LE) and conceptus trophectoderm to attach the conceptus to the uterus for implantation. Research conducted with pigs and sheep has significantly advanced understanding of the role(s) of OPN during implantation through exploitation of the prolonged peri-implantation period of pregnancy when elongating conceptuses are free within the uterine lumen requiring extensive paracrine signaling between conceptus and endometrium. This is followed by a protracted and incremental attachment cascade of trophectoderm to uterine LE during implantation, and development of a true epitheliochorial or synepitheliochorial placenta exhibited by pigs and sheep, respectively. In pigs, implanting conceptuses secrete estrogens which induce the synthesis and secretion of OPN in adjacent uterine LE. OPN then binds to αvβ6 integrin receptors on trophectoderm, and the αvβ3 integrin receptors on uterine LE to bridge conceptus attachment to uterine LE for implantation. In sheep, implanting conceptuses secrete interferon tau that prolongs the lifespan of CL. Progesterone released by CL then induces OPN synthesis and secretion from the endometrial GE into the uterine lumen where OPN binds integrins expressed on trophectoderm (αvβ3) and uterine LE (identity of specific integrins unknown) to adhere the conceptus to the uterus for implantation. OPN binding to the αvβ3 integrin receptor on ovine trophectoderm cells induces in vitro focal adhesion assembly, a prerequisite for adhesion and migration of trophectoderm, through activation of: 1) P70S6K via crosstalk between FRAP1/MTOR and MAPK pathways; 2) MTOR, PI3K, MAPK3/MAPK1 (Erk1/2) and MAPK14 (p38) signaling to stimulate trohectoderm cell migration; and 3) focal adhesion assembly and myosin II motor activity to induce migration of trophectoderm cells. Further large in vivo focal adhesions assemble at the uterine-placental interface of both pigs and sheep and identify the involvement of sizable mechanical forces at this interface during discrete periods of trophoblast migration, attachment and placentation in both species.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractLitter size and birth weights are limited by uterine capacity, defined as the ability of the uterus to maintain the appropriate development of some number of conceptuses. Uterine capacity is the result of the combined effects of uterine, placental and embryo/fetal function. The number of living conceptuses that the uterus is capable of supporting is greater during early gestation compared to later gestation. Plots of log fetal weight versus log placental weight also indicate that fetal weights are less sensitive to reduced placental weight (and therefore reduced intrauterine space) in early gestation compared to late gestation. However, even in late gestation, mechanisms still exist that maintain fetal growth when the size of the placenta is reduced. One such mechanism is likely to be improved development of the folded placental-epithelial/maternal-epithelial bilayer. Fold depth, and therefore the maternal fetal interactive surface, increases as gestation advances and is greater in placenta from small fetuses. On the fetal side of the placenta, the epithelial bilayer is embedded in stromal tissue. Glycosaminoglycans are major components of stroma, including hyaluronan and heparan sulfate. Hyaluronidases and heparanases are present within placental tissues, and likely play roles in modification of stromal components to facilitate fold development. Glycosaminoglycans are polymers of forms of glucose (glucosamine, glucuronic acid, iduronic acid) suggesting that glycosaminoglycan synthesis may compete with the glucose needs of the developing fetus. Pig conceptuses are fructogenic, such that a substantial portion of glucose transferred from mother to fetus is converted to fructose. Fructose is an intermediate product in the synthesis of glucosamine from glucose, and glucosamine is linked to regulation of trophoblast cell proliferation through regulation of mTOR. These findings suggest a link between glucose, fructose, glucosamine synthesis, GAG production, and placental morphogenesis, but the details of these interactions remain unclear. In addition, recent placental epithelial transcriptome analysis identified several glucose, amino acid, lipid, vitamin, mineral and hormone transporter mechanisms within the placenta. Further elucidation of mechanisms of placental morphogenesis and solute transport could provide clues to improving nutrient transport to the pig fetus, potentially increasing litter size and piglet birth weights.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundHamburger is the most consumed beef product in North America, but lacks in nutritional appeal due to its high fat content and high proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA). Objectives of the present study were to improve the FA profiles of hamburgers made with perirenal fat (PRF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) when feeding steers different diets along with examining differences in sensory attributes and oxidative stability. Diets included a control diet containing 70:30 red clover silage: barley based concentrate, a diet containing sunflower-seed (SS) substituted for barley, and diets containing SS with 15% wheat dried distillers’ grain with solubles (DDGS-15) or 30% DDGS (DDGS-30). Hamburgers were made from triceps brachii and either PRF or SCF (80:20 w/w).ResultsPerirenal fat versus SCF hamburgers FA had 14.3% more (P <0.05) 18:0, 11.8% less cis (c) 9-18:1 (P <0.05), and 1.82% more total trans (t)-18:1 mainly in the form of t 11-18:1. During sensory evaluation, PRF versus SCF hamburgers had greater (P <0.05) mouth coating, but the difference was less than one panel unit. Examining effects of steer diet within PRF hamburgers, feeding the SS compared to the control diet increased (P <0.05) t-18:1 by 2.89% mainly in the form of t 11-18:1, feeding DGGS-15 diet led to no further changes (P >0.05), but feeding DDGS-30 diet reduced the proportions of (P <0.05) of t-18:1 chiefly t 11-18:1. Feeding SS and DDGS diets had small but significant (P <0.05) effects on hamburger sensory attributes and oxidative stability.ConclusionsFeeding high-forage diets including SS and 15% DDGS, and taking advantage of the FA heterogeneity between fat depots offers an opportunity to differentially enhance beef hamburgers with 18:2n-6 biohydrogenation products (i.e., t 11-18:1) with potential human health benefits without compromising their sensory attributes and oxidative stability during retail display.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe majority of pregnancy loss in ruminants occurs during the first three weeks after conception, particularly during the period of conceptus elongation that occurs prior to pregnancy recognition and implantation. This review integrates established and new information on the biological role of ovarian progesterone (P4), prostaglandins (PGs), interferon tau (IFNT) and cortisol in endometrial function and conceptus elongation. Progesterone is secreted by the ovarian corpus luteum (CL) and is the unequivocal hormone of pregnancy. Prostaglandins (PGs) and cortisol are produced by both the epithelial cells of the endometrium and the trophectoderm of the elongating conceptus. In contrast, IFNT is produced solely by the conceptus trophectoderm and is the maternal recognition of pregnancy signal that inhibits production of luteolytic pulses of PGF2α by the endometrium to maintain the CL and thus production of P4. Available results in sheep support the idea that the individual, interactive, and coordinated actions of P4, PGs, IFNT and cortisol regulate conceptus elongation and implantation by controlling expression of genes in the endometrium and/or trophectoderm. An increased knowledge of conceptus-endometrial interactions during early pregnancy in ruminants is necessary to understand and elucidate the causes of infertility and recurrent early pregnancy loss and provide new strategies to improve fertility and thus reproductive efficiency.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIdentification of functional genes affecting milk production traits is very crucial for improving breeding efficiency in dairy cattle. Many potential candidate genes have been identified through our previous genome wide association study (GWAS). Of these, GPIHBP1 is an important novel candidate gene for milk production traits. However, the mRNA structure of the bovine GPIHBP1 gene is not fully determined up to now.ResultsIn this study, we identified a novel alternatively splice transcript variant (X5) which leads to a 31\\xa0bp insertion in exon 3 and also confirmed the other four existed transcripts (X1, X2, X3 and X4) of the bovine GPIHBP1 gene. We showed that transcript X5 with a 31\\xa0bp insertion and transcript X1 with an 8\\xa0bp deletion might have tremendous effect on the protein function and structure of GPIHBP1, respectively. With semi-quantitative PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we found that the mRNA expression of GPIHBP1, GPIHBP1-X1 and GPIHBP1-X5 in mammary gland of lactating cows were much higher than that in other tissues.ConclusionsOur study reports a novel alternative splicing of GPIHBP1 in bovine for the first time and provide useful information for the further functional analyses of GPIHBP1 in dairy cattle.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractOxidative stress can induce abnormal tryptophan metabolism. The present study was mainly conducted to determine the effect of dietary tryptophan levels on oxidative stress in the liver of weaned pigs challenged by diquat. A total of 36 PIC piglets weaned at 21\\xa0days of age were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets containing dietary tryptophan levels of 0.18, 0.30, and 0.45% for 14 d. On day 8, the piglets were injected intraperitoneally with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution or diquat (10\\xa0mg/kg body weight). During the first 7 d of trial, increasing dietary tryptophan levels enhanced average daily gain (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) and average daily feed intake (P\\u2009=\\u20090.08), and decreased the feed efficiency (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) of piglets. The growth performance was decreased by diquat injection (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Diquat injection also decreased the activities of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the plasma and liver (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), increased plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and urea nitrogen (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentrations, and enhanced MDA concentration (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07) in liver of piglets. Increasing dietary tryptophan levels could attenuate the effects of diquat injection on the MDA (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) concentration and the activities of SOD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) and GPx (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) of the liver, and plasma urea nitrogen (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) concentration in the piglet. There was a synergistic role for increasing TDO activity in the liver between dietary tryptophan levels and diquat injection (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). These results suggest that increasing dietary tryptophan levels could attenuate the oxidative stress of the liver in weaned piglets intraperitoneally injected with diquat via enhancing the antioxidant capacity.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractEpigenetics provides a molecular mechanism of inheritance that is not solely dependent on DNA sequence and that can account for non-Mendelian inheritance patterns. Epigenetic changes underlie many normal developmental processes, and can lead to disease development as well. While epigenetic effects have been studied in well-characterized rodent models, less research has been done using agriculturally important domestic animal species. This review will present the results of current epigenetic research using farm animal models (cattle, pigs, sheep and chickens). Much of the work has focused on the epigenetic effects that environmental exposures to toxicants, nutrients and infectious agents has on either the exposed animals themselves or on their direct offspring. Only one porcine study examined epigenetic transgenerational effects; namely the effect diet micronutrients fed to male pigs has on liver DNA methylation and muscle mass in grand-offspring (F2 generation). Healthy viable offspring are very important in the farm and husbandry industry and epigenetic differences can be associated with production traits. Therefore further epigenetic research into domestic animal health and how exposure to toxicants or nutritional changes affects future generations is imperative.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe objective of this study was to characterize the changes in various metabolic parameters in blood and milk during IMI challenge with Escherichia coli (E. coli) for dairy cows during early lactation. Thirty, healthy primiparous Holstein cows were infused (h = 0) with ~20-40 cfu of live E. coli into one front mammary quarter at ~4-6 wk in lactation. Daily feed intake and milk yield were recorded. At –12, 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180 and 192 h relative to challenge rectal temperatures were recorded and quarter foremilk was collected for analysis of shedding of E. coli. Composite milk samples were collected at -180, -132, -84, -36, -12, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 132 and 180 h relative to challenge (h = 0) and analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), somatic cell count, fat, protein, lactose, citrate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), free glucose (fglu), and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Blood was collected at -12, 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 60, 72, 84, 132 and 180 h relative to challenge and analyzed for plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), BHBA and glucose concentration. A generalized linear mixed model was used to determine the effect of IMI challenge on metabolic responses of cows during early lactation.ResultsBy 12\\xa0h, E. coli was recovered from challenged quarters and shedding continued through 72\\xa0h. Rectal temperature peaked by 12\\xa0h post-challenge and returned to pre-challenge values by 36\\xa0h post-IMI challenge. Daily feed intake and milk yield decreased (P <0.05) by 1 and 2 d, respectively, after mastitis challenge. Plasma BHBA decreased (12\\xa0h; P <0.05) from 0.96\\u2009±\\u20091.1 at 0\\xa0h to 0.57\\u2009±\\u20090.64\\xa0mmol/L by 18\\xa0h whereas concentration of plasma NEFA (18\\xa0h) and glucose (24\\xa0h) were significantly greater, 11 and 27%, respectively, after challenge. In milk, fglu, lactose, citrate, fat and protein yield were lower whereas yield of BHBA and G6P were higher after challenge when compared to pre-challenge values.ConclusionsChanges in metabolites in blood and milk were most likely associated with drops in feed intake and milk yield. However, the early rise in plasma NEFA may also signify enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis. Lower concentrations of plasma BHBA may be attributed to an increase transfer into milk after IMI. Decreases in both milk lactose yield and % after challenge may be partly attributed to reduced conversion of fglu to lactose. Rises in G6P yield and concentration in milk after challenge (24 h) may signify increased conversion of fglu to G6P. Results identify changes in various metabolic parameters in blood and milk after IMI challenge with E. coli in dairy cows that may partly explain the partitioning of nutrients and changes in milk components after IMI for cows during early lactation.',\n",

Our dRT-PCR assay can be completed in 1.5\\xa0h from when a sample is received to obtaining a result. Additionally, the sensitivity of dRT-PCR matched that of conventional reverse transcription PCR (cRT-PCR) that used purified RNA. The lowest detection limit of HP-PRRSV was 6.3 TCID50 using dRT-PCR. We applied dRT-PCR assay to 144 field samples and the results showed strong consistency with those obtained by cRT-PCR. Moreover, the dRT-PCR method was able to tolerate 5-20% (v/v) serum.ConclusionsOur dRT-PCR assay allows for easier, faster, more cost-effective and higher throughput detection of HP-PRRSV compared with cRT-PCR methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe a real-time RT-PCR assay capable of detecting PRRSV in crude serum samples without the requirement for purifying RNA.

However, a high stocking density can cause oxidative stress and decrease broiler performance. The tryptophan (TRP) derivative 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT) has been shown to preserve membrane fluidity in birds suffering from oxidative stress. Therefore, this experiment was conducted to determine the effects of dietary TRP supplementation on performance, breast meat quality and oxidative stress in broilers reared in cages with a high or low stocking density.MethodsFemale Arbor Acres broilers (25-d-old, n\\u2009=\\u2009144) were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 treatments.

Eight birds from each treatment were slaughtered on d 42 and plasma and breast muscle samples were collected to measure biochemical indices.ResultsA higher stocking density tended to be associated with reduced weight gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10), and significantly increased plasma glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Increased dietary TRP significantly reduced the activities of lactic dehydrogenase and GPT while increasing total cholesterol in the plasma (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), reducing drip loss of breast muscle (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) and improving feed efficiency (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10).ConclusionsAn increase in dietary TRP, 1.5-fold higher than the standard supplementation level, can alleviate oxidative stress as well as improve welfare and feed efficiency in broilers reared in cages with a high stocking density.',\n",

The aim of this study was to quantify total and specific rumen microbial methanogenic populations in beef cattle divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) while offered (i) a low energy high forage (HF) diet followed by (ii) a high energy low forage (LF) diet. Ruminal fluid was collected from 14 high (H) and 14 low (L) RFI animals across both dietary periods. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted to quantify the abundance of total and specific rumen methanogenic microbes. Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the association between the relative abundance of methanogens and animal performance, rumen fermentation variables and diet digestibility.ResultsAbundance of methanogens, did not differ between RFI phenotypes. However, relative abundance of total and specific methanogen species was affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by diet type, with greater abundance observed while animals were offered the LF compared to the HF diet.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that differences in abundance of specific rumen methanogen species may not contribute to variation in CH4 emissions between efficient and inefficient animals, however dietary manipulation can influence the abundance of total and specific methanogen species.',\n",

There were four treatments: a corn-soybean diet without CGF and three corn-soybean diets containing increasing levels of CGF (65, 130, and 195\\xa0g/kg). Data were analyzed according to a randomized complete block design, four blocks with four pigs each (one pig per treatment). The trend of the response (linear or quadratic) was determined using orthogonal contrasts, and when a linear effect was determined, a linear equation was obtained.ResultsThe results showed that the inclusion up to 195\\xa0g/kg of CGF in the corn-soybean diet did not diminish the ileal digestibility (apparent and standardized) of protein and amino acids (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05), except that of phenylalanine, cystine, and proline.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of adding modest amounts of alfalfa forage (22%), achieved by inter-seeding alfalfa into an existing bahiagrass pasture, on baleage nutritive value and lactation performance of Holstein cows. Forage treatments employed were monoculture bahiagrass baleage (MBB; negative control), bahiagrass-alfalfa mixture baleage (BAB) and conventional corn silage (CCS; positive control). Thirty six mid lactation Holstein cows [34.8\\u2009±\\u20095.8\\xa0kg 3.5% fat-corrected milk and 112\\u2009±\\u200919 d in milk (DIM)] were stratified according to milk yield and DIM and assigned randomly to 1 of 3 forage treatments. Cows were trained to Calan feeding gates and were offered a common CCS-based TMR in a 10-d covariance period followed by a 42-d treatment feeding period.ResultsThe BAB contained more protein and less NDF than MBB (12.6 vs 10.3% CP and 71.8 vs 76.6% NDF). Diet DMI was similar for MBB and BAB (19.5 vs 21.6\\xa0kg/hd/d), but cows consumed more of the CCS diet (25.5\\xa0kg/hd/d) than either baleage-based diet. Cows offered BAB tended to produce more milk than cows offered MBB based TMR (28.4 vs 26.1\\xa0kg/hd/d), but both baleage diets generated less milk than CCS-based diets (33.1\\xa0kg/hd/d). Milk composition was similar across diets except for milk protein concentrations which were higher for CCS than either MBB or BAB diets; however, milk urea nitrogen (MUN) was lowest for cows fed CCS diets. Cow BW gain was higher for BAB than MBB implying that a portion of the higher energy contributed by the alfalfa was being used to replenish weight on these mid lactation cows.ConclusionsData from this study indicate that alfalfa inter-seeded in bahiagrass sod that produces BAB with as little as 22% alfalfa may improve nutritive value compared to monoculture bahiagrass baleage and marginally improve lactation performance of Holstein cows.

Immunoaffinity clean-up, using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in combination with UV or Fluorescence Detection, was used for quantitative analysis of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and ochratoxin A (OTA) in the ingredients and complete feeds.ResultsDON and ZEA were the most prevalent mycotoxins found. DON was detected at percentages of 93, 92, 54, 100 and 97% with a mean level of 1.01, 0.44, 0.05, 1.36 and 0.65\\xa0ppm in the samples of corn, wheat bran, soybean meal, DDGS and complete feeds, respectively. The detected percentages of ZEA were 100, 100, 54, 100 and 100 with mean levels of 109.1, 14.9, 9.2, 882.7 and 58.9\\xa0ppb in the same samples. In the wheat bran and soybean meal samples, the content of all four mycotoxins were below the maximum limits set by Chinese regulations while the percentage of samples that exceeded regulatory limits were 7, 57 and 7% for corn, and 7, 14 and 3% for the complete feeds for AFB1, DON and OTA respectively. DDGS showed the most serious mycotoxin contamination and the percentage of samples that exceeded regulatory limits were 6, 88 and 41%, for AFB1, DON and ZEA, respectively.ConclusionsThis paper is the first to present data on the natural occurrence of AFB1, DON, ZEA and OTA in ingredients and complete feeds obtained from swine farms in China’s Beijing region. The data shows that feed ingredients and complete swine feeds obtained from these farms are most often contaminated with DON followed by contamination with AFB1 and ZEA.',\n",

It has been realized by many investigators that altered lactation, long dry periods (non-milking period between two consecutive lactation cycles), abrupt cessation of lactation (common in water buffaloes) and disease conditions like mastitis, greatly reduce milk yield thus render huge financial losses within the dairy sector. Cellular manipulation of specialized cell types within the mammary gland, called mammary stem cells (MaSCs)/progenitor cells, might provide potential solutions to these problems and may improve milk production. In addition, MaSCs/progenitor cells could be used in regenerative therapy against tissue damage caused by mastitis. This review discusses methods of MaSC/progenitor cell manipulation and their mechanisms in bovine and caprine animals. Author believes that intervention of MaSCs/progenitor cells could lessen the huge financial losses to the dairy industry globally.',\n",

Are the same genes also correlated with IMF% in sheep muscle, and can the same set of genes be used to estimate IMF% in both species?ResultsThe correlation between gene expression (microarray) and IMF% in the longissimus muscle (LM) of twenty sheep was calculated. An integrated analysis of this dataset with an equivalent cattle correlation dataset and a cattle differential expression dataset was undertaken. A total of 30 genes were identified to be strongly correlated with IMF% in both cattle and sheep. The overlap of genes was highly significant, 8 of the 13 genes in the TAG gene set and 8 of the 13 genes in the FA gene set were in the top 100 and 500 genes respectively most correlated with IMF% in sheep, P-value = 0. Of the 30 genes, CIDEA, THRSP, ACSM1, DGAT2 and FABP4 had the highest average rank in both species. Using the data from two small groups of Brahman cattle (control and Hormone growth promotant-treated [known to decrease IMF% in muscle]) and 22 animals in total, the utility of a direct measure and different estimators of IMF% (ultrasound and gene expression) to differentiate between the two groups were examined. Directly measured IMF% and IMF% estimated from ultrasound scanning could not discriminate between the two groups. However, using gene expression to estimate IMF% discriminated between the two groups. Increasing the number of genes used to estimate IMF% from one to five significantly increased the discrimination power; but increasing the number of genes to 15 resulted in little further improvement.ConclusionWe have demonstrated the utility of a comparative approach to identify robust estimators of IMF% in the LM in cattle and sheep. We have also demonstrated a number of approaches (potentially applicable to much smaller groups of animals than conventional methods) to using gene expression to rank animals for IMF% within a single farm/treatment, or to estimate differences in IMF% between two farms/treatments.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractAmino acids are building blocks for proteins in all animals. Based on growth or nitrogen balance, amino acids were traditionally classified as nutritionally essential or nonessential for mammals, birds and fish. It was assumed that all the “nutritionally nonessential amino acids (NEAA)” were synthesized sufficiently in the body to meet the needs for maximal growth and optimal health. However, careful analysis of the scientific literature reveals that over the past century there has not been compelling experimental evidence to support this assumption. NEAA (e.g., glutamine, glutamate, proline, glycine and arginine) play important roles in regulating gene expression, cell signaling, antioxidative responses, fertility, neurotransmission, and immunity. Additionally, glutamate, glutamine and aspartate are major metabolic fuels for the small intestine to maintain its digestive function and to protect the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. Thus, diets for animals must contain all NEAA to optimize their survival, growth, development, reproduction, and health. Furthermore, NEAA should be taken into consideration in revising the “ideal protein” concept that is currently used to formulate swine and poultry diets. Adequate provision of all amino acids (including NEAA) in diets enhances the efficiency of animal production. In this regard, amino acids should not be classified as nutritionally essential or nonessential in animal or human nutrition. The new Texas A&M University’s optimal ratios of dietary amino acids for swine and chickens are expected to beneficially reduce dietary protein content and improve the efficiency of their nutrient utilization, growth, and production performance.',\n",

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of trans-10, cis- 12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the development and cryotolerance of crossbred Bos primigenius taurus x Bos primigenius indicus embryos produced in vitro, and cultured in the presence of fetal calf serum. Bovine zygotes (n\\u2009=\\u20091,692) were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: 1) Control, zygotes cultured in Charles Rosenkrans 2 amino acid (CR2aa) medium (n\\u2009=\\u2009815) or 2) CLA, zygotes cultured in CR2aa medium supplemented with 100\\u2009μmol/L of trans- 10, cis-12 CLA (n\\u2009=\\u2009877). Embryo development (cleavage and blastocyst rates evaluated at days 3 and 8 of culture, respectively), lipid content at morula stage (day 5) and blastocyst cryotolerance (re-expansion and hatching rates, evaluated 24 and 72\\u2009h post-thawing, respectively) were compared between groups. Additionally, selected mRNA transcripts were measured by Real–Time PCR in blastocyst stage.ResultsThe CLA treatment had no effect on cleavage and blastocyst rates, or on mRNA levels for genes related to cellular stress and apoptosis. On the other hand, abundance of mRNA for the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate 0-acyltransferase-encoding gene (AGPAT), which is involved in triglycerides synthesis, and consequently neutral lipid content, were reduced by CLA treatment. A significant increase was observed in the re-expansion rate of embryos cultured with trans-10, cis- 12 CLA when compared to control (56.3 vs. 34.4%, respectively, P\\u2009=\\u20090.002). However, this difference was not observed in the hatching rate (16.5 vs. 14.0%, respectively, P\\u2009=\\u20090.62).ConclusionsThe supplementation with trans-10, cis- 12 CLA isomer in culture medium reduced the lipid content of in vitro produced bovine embryos by reducing the gene expression of 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate 0-acyltransferase (AGPAT) enzyme. However, a possible improvement in embryo cryotolerance in response to CLA, as suggested by increased blastocyst re-expansion rate, was not confirmed by hatching rates.',\n",

It is believed that along with biodiesel from algae, the high protein de-oiled algal residue may become an alternative feed supplement option in the future. This study was conducted to investigate de-oiled algal residue obtained from the common Chlorella species, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Selenarstrum capricornutum, Scenedesmus sp., and Scenedesmus dimorphus for assessment as potential feed supplements for ruminants by comparing with soybean (Glycine max) meal and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay.ResultsWith the exception of T. weissflogii, algal residue had higher concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Mn and lower concentration of Ca, Mg, and K than soybean meal and alfalfa hay. The algal residue CP (crude protein) concentrations ranged from 140 to 445\\xa0g/kg DM and varied among the de-oiled residues. In vitro rumen fermentation gas accumulation curves indicated that algal biomass degradation potential was less than that of soybean meal or alfalfa hay by up to 41.7%.The gas production curve, interpreted with a dual pool logistic model, confirmed that the fraction sizes for fast fermenting and slow fermenting of de-oiled algal residues were smaller than those in soybean meal and alfalfa hay, and the fermenting rate of the fractions was also low.ConclusionsInferior in vitro rumen gas accumulation from the five de-oiled algal residues suggests that these algal byproducts are less degradable in the rumen.',\n",

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of reduced energy density of close-up diets on dry matter intake (DMI), lactation performance and energy balance (EB) in multiparous Holstein cows which were housed in a free-stall barn and fed for ad libitum intake. Thirty-nine dry cows were blocked and assigned randomly to three groups fed a high energy density diet [HD, n\\u2009=\\u200913; 6.8\\xa0MJ of net energy for lactation (NEL)/kg; 14.0% crude protein (CP) ], or a middle energy density diet (MD, n\\u2009=\\u200913; 6.2\\xa0MJ NEL/kg; 14.0% CP), or a low energy density diet (LD, n\\u2009=\\u200913; 5.4\\xa0MJ NEL/kg; 14.0% CP) from d 21 before expected day of calving. After parturition, all cows were fed the same lactation diet to d 70 in milk (DIM). The DMI and NEL intake prepartum were decreased by the reduced energy density diets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The LD group consumed 1.3\\xa0kg/d (DM) more diet compared with HD group in the last 24\\xa0h before calving. The milk yield and the postpartum DMI were increased by the reduced energy density diet prepartum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The changes in BCS and BW prepartum and postpartum were not affected by prepartum diets. HD group had higher milk fat content and lower lactose content compared with LD group during the first 3\\xa0wk of lactation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The energy consumption for HD, MD and LD groups were 149.8%, 126.2% and 101.1% of their calculated energy requirements prepartum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and 72.7%, 73.1% and 75.2% during the first 4\\xa0wk postpartum, respectively. In conclusion, the low energy density prepartum diet was effective in controlling NEL intake prepartum, and was beneficial in increasing DMI and milk yield, and alleviating negative EB postpartum.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundFatty acid (FA) composition is the most important parameter affecting the flavor and nutritional value of the meat. The final and the only committed step in the biosynthesis of triglycerides is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). The role of DGAT2 in lipid accumulation has been demonstrated in adipocytes, However, little is known about the effect of DGAT2 on the FA composition of these cells.MethodsTo investigate the role of DGAT2 in regulating lipid accumulation, FA composition and the expression of adipogenic genes, we cloned the open reading frame of the porcine DGAT2 gene and established 3T3-L1 cells that overexpressed DGAT2. Cells were then cultured in differentiation medium (DM) without FA, with a mixture of FAs (FA-DM), or containing a 13C stable isotope-labeled FA mixture (IFA-DM). The FA composition of adipocytes was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Quantitative PCR and western blotting were employed to detect expression of adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured with FA-DM for 12 d.ResultsThe triacylglyceride (TAG) content was significantly higher in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells. When cultured in DM or FA-DM for 12 d, cells overexpressing DGAT2 showed a higher proportion of unsaturated FAs (C16:1 and C18:1). However, when cells overexpressing DGAT2 were cultured with FA-DM for 30\\xa0min, the FA composition was almost identical to that of controls. Further, the proportion of stable isotope-labeled FAs were similar in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing DGAT2 and control cells cultured in IFA-DM for 12 d. These results collectively indicate that the higher proportion of mono-unsaturated FAs, C16:1 and C18:1, may originate from de novo FA synthesis but not from the uptake of specific FAs from the medium. This hypothesis is further supported by evidence that both mRNA and protein expression of genes involved in FA synthesis (ACACA, FASN, SCD1, and A-FABP) were significantly higher in cells overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our study revealed that TAG accumulation, the proportion of MUFAs, and the expression of adipogenic genes were higher in 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe importance of non-glucose carbohydrates, especially mannose and inositol, for normal development is increasingly recognized. Whether pregnancies complicated by abnormal glucose transfer to the fetus also affect the regulation of non-glucose carbohydrates is unknown. In pregnant sheep, maternal insulin infusions were used to reduce glucose supply to the fetus for both short (2-wk) and long (8-wk) durations to test the hypothesis that a maternal insulin infusion would suppress fetal mannose and inositol concentrations. We also used direct fetal insulin infusions (1-wk hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp) to determine the relative importance of fetal glucose and insulin for regulating non-glucose carbohydrates.ResultsA maternal insulin infusion resulted in lower maternal (50%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and fetal (35-45%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) mannose concentrations, which were highly correlated (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.69, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). A fetal insulin infusion resulted in a 50% reduction of fetal mannose (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Neither maternal nor fetal plasma inositol changed with exogenous insulin infusions. Additionally, maternal insulin infusion resulted in lower fetal sorbitol and fructose (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).ConclusionsChronically decreased glucose supply to the fetus as well as fetal hyperinsulinemia both reduce fetal non-glucose carbohydrates. Given the role of these carbohydrates in protein glycosylation and lipid production, more research on their metabolism in pregnancies complicated by abnormal glucose metabolism is clearly warranted.',\n",

Twelve growing barrows (initial body weight: 76.1\\u2009±\\u20096.2\\xa0kg) were randomly allotted to a replicated 6 × 4 Youden square design with 6 diets and 4 periods. The fat content of the 3 sources of DDGS were 11.5, 7.5, and 6.9% respectively. Diets contained 60% DDGS and fat concentration of the diets were 7.5, 5.2, and 5.2%, respectively. Two additional diets containing the 2 sources of DDGS with 7.5 and 6.9% fat were also formulated, and corn oil was added to these diets to increase the concentration of fat in the diets to levels that were calculated to be similar to the diet containing conventional DDGS with 11.5% fat. A N-free diet was also formulated to calculate endogenous losses of crude protein (CP) and AA from the pigs. Pigs were fed experimental diets during four 7-d periods. The first 5 d of each period were an adaptation period and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. The apparent ileal digestibililty (AID) and SID of CP and all indispensable AA, except AID Pro and SID of Trp, were greater (P < 0.01) in conventional DDGS than in the 2 sources of DDGS with reduced fat. Adding oil to the diets containing the 2 sources of DDGS with reduced fat did not consistently increase SID of AA. In conclusion, conventional DDGS has greater SID values for most AA compared with DDGS that contains less fat and inclusion of additional oil to diets containing low-fat DDGS does not increase AID or SID of AA. The lower AA digestibility in low-fat DDGS could not be overcome by the inclusion of additional fat to the diets.',\n",

The main goal of our study was to investigate the ability of endometrial explants and cells treated with E2 and the calcium ionophore (CI) A23187 to synthesize PGF2α.ResultsTreatment with E2in vivo resulted in a 48.4% increase of PGF2α production by endometrial explants treated in vitro with A23187. Production of PGF2α was better stimulated with A23187 at concentrations of 10-6 and 10-5 mol/L compared with other concentrations used. The concentration of PGF2α for untreated bovine endometrial cell cultures was 33.1 pg/mL, while for cultures treated with E2, A23187, or a combination of E2 and A23187, the PGF2α concentration was 32.5, 92.4 and 145.6 pg/mL, respectively.ConclusionsTreatment with A23187 tended to stimulate PGF2α production.

Each period consisted of four phases, each of which lasted 17\\xa0d: 10\\xa0d for dietary adaptation, 6\\xa0d for degradation study, and 1\\xa0d for rumen sample collection. From the 1st to the 4th phase, steers were fed in a stepwise fashion with increasing CTFRs, i.e., 30:70, 50:50, 70:30, and 90:10. The kinetics of dry matter and fiber degradation of alfalfa pellets were evaluated; the rumen microbial populations were detected using real-time PCR.

Dietary CTFR had a significant effect (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) on degradation characteristics of alfalfa pellets and the copies of rumen microorganism; the increasing concentrate level resulted in linear, quadratic or cubic variation trend for these parameters. SC supplementation significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) affected dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradation rates (cDM, cNDF) and NDF effective degradability (EDNDF). Compared with the control group, there was an increasing trend of rumen fungi and protozoa in SC group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.1); copies of total bacteria in SC group were significantly higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, percentage of Ruminobacter amylophilus was significantly lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) but percentage of Selenomonas ruminantium was significantly higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the SC group. In a word, dietary CTFR had a significant effect on degradation characteristics of forage and rumen microbial population. S. cerevisiae had positive effects on DM and NDF degradation rate or effective degradability of forage; S. cerevisiae increased rumen total bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and lactate-utilizing bacteria but reduced starch-degrading and lactate-producing bacteria.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundPhosphorus (P) supplementation is costly and can result in excess P excretion. This study investigated the effects of reducing dietary P on milk production and P excretion in dairy cows over a full lactation.MethodForty-five multiparous Holstein dairy cows were divided into 15 blocks according to expected calving date and previous milk yield, and assigned randomly to one of the three dietary treatments: 0.37, 0.47, and 0.57% P (DM basis); these P levels represent the NRC recommendations, Chinese recommendations, and the amount of dietary P commonly fed by Chinese dairy farmers, respectively. Average daily feed intake was calculated from monthly data on feed offered and refused. Milk yields of individual cows were recorded weekly, and milk samples were taken for analysis of protein, fat, solids-not-fat, lactose, and somatic cell count. Blood samples were collected on days −6, −3, 0, 3, 6 relative to calving, and then monthly throughout lactation, and analyzed for P and Ca concentrations. Spot samples of feces and urine were collected for 3 consecutive d during weeks 12, 24, and 36, and P concentrations were analyzed. Reproduction and health data were recorded.ResultsDietary P did not affect dry matter intake or milk yield (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10). Milk fat content was slightly higher in cows fed 0.37% P than in cows fed 0.47% P (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05). Serum concentrations of P and Ca did not reflect dietary P content (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10). Fecal and urinary P both declined linearly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) as dietary P decreased from 0.57 to 0.37%. Fecal P content was 25% less when dietary P was 0.37% compared to 0.57%. Health events and reproductive performance were not associated with dietary P content (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05).ConclusionsLowering dietary P from 0.57 to 0.37% did not negatively affect milk production, but did significantly reduce P excretion into environment.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractCommercial milking of sheep is a new agricultural industry in the United States starting approximately 30\\xa0yr ago. The industry is still small, but it is growing. The majority of the sheep milk is used in the production of specialty cheeses. The United States is the major importer of sheep milk cheeses with 50 to 60% of annual world exports coming to the United States during the past 20\\xa0yr. Therefore, there is considerable growth potential for the industry in the United States. The only dairy sheep research flock in North America is located at the Spooner Agricultural Research Station of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The research program started in 1993 and has been multifaceted; dealing with several areas important to commercial dairy sheep farmers. The East Friesian and Lacaune dairy breeds were compared and introduced to the industry through the research program. Both dairy breeds produced significantly more milk than traditional meat-wool breeds found in the U.S., but the two breeds differed in their production traits. East Friesian-cross ewes produced more lambs and slightly more milk than Lacaune-cross ewes whereas Lacaune-cross ewes produced milk with a higher percentage of fat and protein than East Friesian-cross ewes. Lactation physiology studies have shown that ewes with active corpora lutea have increased milk yields, oxytocin release during milking is required to obtain normal fat percentages in the milk, large udder cisterns of dairy ewes can allow for increased milking intervals, and short daylengths during late pregnancy results in increased milk yield. In the nutrition area, legume-grass pastures and forages with a higher percentage of legume will result in increased milk production. Grazing ewes respond to additional supplementation with increased milk yield, but it is important to match the supplement to the quality of the grazing. Ewes on high quality legume-grass pastures that are high in rumen degradable protein respond with increased milk production to supplements high in energy and/or high in rumen undegraded protein.',\n",

The treatments were - (1) high energy/low protein (HELP), (2) high energy/high protein (HEHP), (3) low energy/low protein (LELP) and (4) low energy/high protein (LEHP). Each treatment used 6 steers and 6 heifers, except for HELP- 5 steers and 6 heifers.ResultsGrowth rate and final carcass weight were unaffected by dietary energy and protein levels or by sex. Compared with the LE diet group, the HE group had significantly lower dry matter intake (DMI, 6.76 vs. 7.48\\xa0kg DM/d), greater chest girth increments (46.1 vs. 36.8\\xa0cm), higher carcass fat (19.9 vs.16.3%) and intramuscular fat content (29.9 vs. 22.8% DM). The HE group also had improved yields of top and medium top grade commercial meat cuts (39.9 vs.36.5%). The dressing percentage was higher for the HP group than the LP group (53.4 vs. 54.9%). Steers had a greater length increment (9.0 vs. 8.3\\xa0cm), but lower carcass fat content (16.8 vs. 19.4%) than heifers. The meat quality traits (shear force value, drip loss, cooking loss and water holding capacity) were not affected by treatments or sex, averaging 3.14\\xa0kg, 2.5, 31.5 and 52.9%, respectively. The nutritive profiles (both fatty and amino acid composition) were not influenced by the energy or protein levels or by sex.ConclusionsThe dietary energy and protein levels and sex significantly influenced the carcass characteristics and chemical composition of meat but not thegrowth performance, meat quality traits and nutritive profiles.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundConsuming moderate amounts of lean red meat as part of a balanced diet valuably contributes to intakes of essential nutrients. In this study, we merged phenotypic and genotypic information to characterize the variation in lipid profile and sensory parameters and to represent the diversity among 15 cattle populations. Correlations between fat content, organoleptic characteristics and lipid profiles were also investigated.MethodsA sample of 436 largely unrelated purebred bulls belonging to 15 breeds and reared under comparable management conditions was analyzed. Phenotypic data -including fatness score, fat percentage, individual fatty acids (FA) profiles and sensory panel tests- and genotypic information from 11 polymorphisms was used.ResultsThe correlation coefficients between muscle total lipid measurements and absolute vs. relative amounts of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were in opposite directions. Increasing carcass fat leads to an increasing amount of FAs in triglycerides, but at the same time the relative amount of PUFAs is decreasing, which is in concordance with the negative correlation obtained here between the percentage of PUFA and fat measurements, as well as the weaker correlation between total phospholipids and total lipid muscle content compared with neutral lipids. Concerning organoleptic characteristics, a negative correlation between flavour scores and the percentage of total PUFA, particularly to n-6 fraction, was found. The correlation between juiciness and texture is higher than with flavour scores. The distribution of SNPs plotted by principal components analysis (PCA) mainly reflects their known trait associations, although influenced by their specific breed allele frequencies.ConclusionsThe results presented here help to understand the phenotypic and genotypic background underlying variations in FA composition and sensory parameters between breeds. The wide range of traits and breeds studied, along with the genotypic information on polymorphisms previously associated with different lipid traits, provide a broad characterization of beef meat, which allows giving a better response to the variety of consumers’ preferences. Also, the development and implementation of low-density SNP panels with predictive value for economically important traits, such as those summarized here, may be used to improve production efficiency and meat quality in the beef industry.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundAt present, vitrification has been widely applied to humans, mice and farm animals. To improve the efficiency of vitrification in straw, bovine oocytes were used to test a new two-step vitrification method in this study.ResultsWhen in vitro matured oocytes were exposed to 20% ethylene glycol (EG20) for 5\\xa0min and 40% ethylene glycol (EG40) for 30\\xa0s, followed by treatment with 30% glycerol (Gly30), Gly40 or Gly50, a volume expansion was observed in Gly30 and Gly40 but not Gly50. This indicates that the intracellular osmotic pressure after a 30\\xa0s differs between EG40 and ranged between Gly40 (approximately 5.6\\xa0mol/L) and Gly50 (approximately 7.0\\xa0mol/L). Since oocytes are in EG40 just for only a short period of time (30\\xa0s) and at a lower temperature (4°C), we hypothesize that the main function of this step in to induce dehydration. Based on these results, we omitted the EG40 step, before oocytes were pretreated in EG20 for 5\\xa0min, exposed to pre-cooled (4°C) Gly50, for 30\\xa0s, and then dipped into liquid nitrogen. After warming, 81.1% of the oocytes survived, and the surviving oocytes developed into cleavage stage embryos (63.5%) or blastocysts (20.0%) after parthenogenetic activation.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that in a two-step vitrification procedure, the permeability effect in the second step is not necessary. It is possible that the second step is only required to provide adequate osmotic pressure to condense the intracellular concentration of CPAs to a level required for successful vitrification.',\n",

The experiment examined corn variety (LS1, LS2, LS3 and LS4) grown in one location, drying method (sun dried and artificially dried) and different drying temperatures. Corn harvested at 20-25% moisture was dried to about 12% moisture by sun drying and artificially drying at 80, 100, or 120°C in a fluidized bed dryer. Ninety-six barrows (average BW of 33.4\\u2009±\\u20092.7\\xa0kg) were housed in individual metabolism crates to facilitate separate collection of feces and urine. A five-day collection period followed a seven-day diet acclimation period.ResultsThe results indicated that variety significantly influenced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) the 1,000 kernel weight of corn but not the bulk weight. Variety also influenced the available energy content (digestible energy of dry matter, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01; metabolisable energy of dry matter, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and digestibility of organic matter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), as well as dry matter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and gross energy (GE) content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.02).

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe processes of weaning and exposure to pathogenic bacteria induce stress responses, which may alter the metabolism. In this study, we investigated the changes in plasma metabolites and immune responses in piglets in response to the stress induced by weaning and Escherichia coli challenge.ResultsFecal dry matter decreased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.003) and nearly half (44.4%) the piglets developed diarrhea on day 2 and 3 postweaning. The concentration of plasma immunoglobulin A was higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) on day 11 postweaning than on day 0 or 4 postweaning. The levels of white blood cells increased continuously (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) from day 0 to day 11 postweaning. Differences in the percentages of neutrophils (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029) and lymphocytes (P\\u2009=\\u20090.022) were seen, but the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio did not differ in the period after weaning. A clear separation of the metabolomic profile data for day 0 and day 4 postweaning was observed with a principal components analysis (PCA) scores plot, and the data for day 11 were located between those for day 0 and day 4 postweaning. The plasma levels of proline, taurine, and carnitine were higher, whereas those of betaine, creatine, L-arginine and acetylcarnitine were lower on day 4 postweaning than on day 0. Levels of lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine were either higher or lower after weaning, depending on the chain lengths or characters of these metabolites.ConclusionsOur results show a clear separation in the plasma metabolomic profiles of piglets that corresponded to the fecal responses to stress on the piglets induced by weaning or exposure to a pathogen (E. coli). These plasma metabolite profiles suggest that the challenges induced proinflammatory responses in the piglets, resulting in postweaning diarrhea, which was associated with higher concentrations of IgA in the plasma.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractDietary fiber is associated with impaired nutrient utilization and reduced net energy values. However, fiber has to be included in the diet to maintain normal physiological functions in the digestive tract. Moreover, the negative impact of dietary fiber will be determined by the fiber properties and may differ considerably between fiber sources. Various techniques can be applied to enhance nutritional value and utilization of available feed resources. In addition, the extent of fiber utilization is affected by the age of the pig and the pig breed. The use of potential prebiotic effects of dietary fiber is an attractive way to stimulate gut health and thereby minimize the use of anti-microbial growth promoters. Inclusion of soluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in the diet can stimulate the growth of commensal gut microbes. Inclusion of NSP from chicory results in changes in gut micro-environment and gut morphology of pigs, while growth performance remains unaffected and digestibility was only marginally reduced. The fermentation products and pH in digesta responded to diet type and were correlated with shifts in the microbiota. Interestingly, fiber intake will have an impact on the expression of intestinal epithelial heat-shock proteins in the pig. Heat-shock proteins have an important physiological role in the gut and carry out crucial housekeeping functions in order to maintain the mucosal barrier integrity. Thus, there are increasing evidence showing that fiber can have prebiotic effects in pigs due to interactions with the gut micro-environment and the gut associated immune system.',\n",

Urease B subunit, one of the two structural subunits of urease, was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Helicobacter pylori urease B subunit on the immune responses in mice by subcutaneous immunization.MethodsThe mice were immunized and boosted with Helicobacter pylori urease B subunit antigen subcutaneously three times with 2-wk intervals between the immunizations and boosters. The mice in the control group were immunized with PBS. The adjuvant group received PBS containing complete/incomplete freund’s adjuvant identical to antigen group without Helicobacter pylori urease B subunit antigen. Four weeks after the final booster, all the mice were sacrificed. Blood was collected on d 0, 14, 28 and 56 before immunization, booster and sacrifice, respectively. Immediately after sacrifice, gastric liquid and spleen were collected for antibody and cytokine analyses.ResultsUrease B subunit increased the concentrations of serum and gastric anti-urease B antigen specific IgG, and the levels of interleukin-4 and interferon-γ in splenocytes of the mice (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that recombinant urease B subunit can induce systemic and local immune responses in mice by subcutaneous immunization, which might be used as the effective component of vaccine against Helicobacter pylori.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCurrent research to enrich cattle feed has primarily focused on treatment using white rot fungi, while there are scarce reports using the enzyme tannase, which is discussed only in reviews or in the form of a hypothesis. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of tannase on wheat straw (WS) and also the effect of lyophilized tannase at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% (w/w) on WS followed by fermentation with Ganoderma sp. for 10 d and compared in relation to biochemical parameters, crude protein (CP) content, and nutritional value by calculating the C/N ratio in order to improve the nutritional value of cattle feed.ResultsPenicillium charlesii, a tannase-producing microorganism, produced 61.4\\xa0IU/mL of tannase in 54\\xa0h when 2% (w/v) tannic acid (TA) was initially used as a substrate in medium containing (%\\xa0w/v) sucrose (1.0), NaNO3 (1.0), and MgSO4 (0.08 pH, 5.0) in a 300-L fermentor (working volume 220\\xa0L), and concomitantly fed with 1.0% (w/v) TA after 24\\xa0h. The yield of partially purified and lyophilized tannase was 5.8\\xa0IU/mg. The tannin-free myco-straw at 0.1% (w/w) tannase showed 37.8% (w/w) lignin degradation with only a 20.4% (w/w) decrease in cellulose content and the in vitro feed digestibility was 32.2%. An increase in CP content (up to 1.28-fold) along with a lower C/N ratio of 25.0%, as compared to myco-straw, was obtained.ConclusionsThe use of tannin-free myco-straw has potential to improve the nutritional content of cattle feed. This biological treatment process was safe, eco-friendly, easy to perform, and was less expensive as compared to other treatment methods.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractImmune system activation begins a host of physiological responses. Infectious agents are recognized by monocytes and macrophages which in turn stimulate cytokine production. It is the hormone-like factors called cytokines that orchestrate the immune response. The classic responses observed with immune system activation and cytokine production include: anorexia, fever, lethargy, recruitment of other immune cells, and phagocytosis. While production of immune system components is known to require some amino acids, increases in amino acid requirements are more than offset by the associated decrease in protein accretion and increased muscle protein degradation that also accompanies immune system activation. However, the biggest impact of cytokine production is a decrease in feed intake. Therefore, as feed intake decreases, the energy needed to drive protein synthesis is also decreased. This suggests that diets should still be formulated on a similar calorie:lysine ratio as those formulated for non-immune challenged pigs. The evidence is sparse or equivocal for increasing nutrient requirements during an immune challenge. Nutritionists and swine producers should resist the pressure to alter the diet, limit feed, or add expensive feed additives during an immune challenge. While immune stimulation does not necessitate changes in diet formulation, when pigs are challenged with non-pathogenic diarrhea there are potential advantages on gut health with the increased use of crystalline amino acids rather than intact protein sources (i.e., soybean meal). This is because reducing crude protein decreases the quantity of fermentable protein entering the large intestine, which lowers post weaning diarrhea. It also lowers the requirement for expensive specialty protein sources or other protein sources such as soybean meal that present immunological challenges to the gut. The objective of this review is two-fold. The first is to discuss immunity by nutrition interactions, or lack thereof, and secondly, to review amino acid requirement estimates for nursery pigs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe nutrient composition of corn is variable. To prevent unforeseen reductions in growth performance, grading and analytical methods are used to minimize nutrient variability between calculated and analyzed values. This experiment was carried out to define the sources of variation in the energy content of corn and to develop a practical method to accurately estimate the digestible energy (DE) and metabolisable energy (ME) content of individual corn samples for growing pigs. Twenty samples were taken from each of five provinces in China (Jilin, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, and Henan) to obtain a range of quality.ResultsThe DE and ME contents of the 100 corn samples were measured in 35.3\\u2009±\\u20091.92\\xa0kg growing pigs (six pigs per corn sample). Sixty corn samples were used to build the prediction model; the remaining forty samples were used to test the suitability of these models. The chemical composition of each corn sample was determined, and the results were used to establish prediction equations for DE or ME content from chemical characteristics. The mean DE and ME content of the 100 samples were 4,053 and 3,923\\xa0kcal/kg (dry matter basis), respectively. The physical characteristics were determined, as well, and the results indicated that the bulk weight and 1,000-kernel weight were not associated with energy content. The DE and ME values could be accurately predicted from chemical characteristics. The best fit equations were as follows: DE, kcal/kg of DM\\u2009=\\u20091062.68\\u2009+\\u2009(49.72\\u2009×\\u2009EE)\\u2009+\\u2009(0.54\\u2009×\\u2009GE)\\u2009+\\u2009(9.11\\u2009×\\u2009starch), with R2\\u2009=\\u20090.62, residual standard deviation (RSD)\\u2009=\\u200948\\xa0kcal/kg, and P\\u2009<\\u20090.01; ME, kcal/kg of dry matter basis (DM)\\u2009=\\u2009671.54\\u2009+\\u2009(0.89\\u2009×\\u2009DE) – (5.57\\u2009×\\u2009NDF) – (191.39\\u2009×\\u2009ash), with R2\\u2009=\\u20090.87, RSD\\u2009=\\u200918\\xa0kcal/kg, and P\\u2009<\\u20090.01.ConclusionThis experiment confirms the large variation in the energy content of corn, describes the factors that influence this variation, and presents equations based on chemical measurements that may be used to predict the DE and ME content of individual corn samples.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractHypoxia is a physiological or pathological condition of a deficiency of oxygen supply in the body as a whole or within a tissue. During hypoxia, tissues undergo a series of physiological responses to defend themselves against a low oxygen supply, including increased angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose uptake. The effects of hypoxia are mainly mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which is a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of α and β subunits. HIF-1β is constantly expressed, whereas HIF-1α is degraded under normal oxygen conditions. Hypoxia stabilizes HIF-1α and the HIF complex, and HIF then translocates into the nucleus to initiate the expression of target genes. Hypoxia has been extensively studied for its role in promoting tumor progression, and emerging evidence also indicates that hypoxia may play important roles in physiological processes, including mammary development and lactation. The mammary gland exhibits an increasing metabolic rate from pregnancy to lactation to support mammary growth, lactogenesis, and lactation. This process requires increasing amounts of oxygen consumption and results in localized chronic hypoxia as confirmed by the binding of the hypoxia marker pimonidazole HCl in mouse mammary gland. We hypothesized that this hypoxic condition promotes mammary development and lactation, a hypothesis that is supported by the following several lines of evidence: i) Mice with an HIF-1α deletion selective for the mammary gland have impaired mammary differentiation and lipid secretion, resulting in lactation failure and striking changes in milk compositions; ii) We recently observed that hypoxia significantly induces HIF-1α-dependent glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression in mammary epithelial cells, which may be responsible for the dramatic increases in glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression in the mammary gland during the transition period from late pregnancy to early lactation; and iii) Hypoxia and HIF-1α increase the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 5a (STAT5a) in mammary epithelial cells, whereas STAT5 phosphorylation plays important roles in the regulation of milk protein gene expression and mammary development. Based on these observations, hypoxia effects emerge as a new frontier for studying the regulation of mammary development and lactation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe rapid gain in lean mass in neonates requires greater rates of protein synthesis than degradation. We previously delineated the molecular mechanisms by which insulin and amino acids, especially leucine, modulate skeletal muscle protein synthesis and how this changes with development. In the current study, we identified mechanisms involved in protein degradation regulation. In experiment 1, 6- and 26-d-old pigs were studied during 1) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic, 2) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-hyperaminoacidemic, and 3) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic clamps for 2\\xa0h. In experiment 2, 5-d-old pigs were studied during 1) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic-euleucinemic, 2) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-hypoaminoacidemic-hyperleucinemic, and 3) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic-hyperleucinemic clamps for 24\\xa0h. We determined in muscle indices of ubiquitin-proteasome, i.e., atrogin-1 (MAFbx) and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1) and autophagy-lysosome systems, i.e., unc51-like kinase 1 (UKL1), microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (Lamp-2). For comparison, we measured ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) activation, components of translation initiation.ResultsAbundance of atrogin-1, but not MuRF1, was greater in 26- than 6-d-old pigs and was not affected by insulin, amino acids, or leucine. Abundance of ULK1 and LC3 was higher in younger pigs and not affected by treatment. The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was reduced and ULK1 phosphorylation increased by insulin, amino acids, and leucine. These responses were more profound in younger pigs. Abundance of Lamp-2 was not affected by treatment or development. Abundance of eIF4E, but not rpS6, was higher in 6- than 26-d-old-pigs but unaffected by treatment. Phosphorylation of eIF4E was not affected by treatment, however, insulin, amino acids, and leucine stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation, and the responses decreased with development.ConclusionsThe rapid growth of neonatal muscle is in part due to the positive balance between the activation of protein synthesis and degradation signaling. Insulin, amino acids, and, particularly, leucine, act as signals to modulate muscle protein synthesis and degradation in neonates.',\n",

Pers.] hays of different qualities was evaluated. Eight ruminally cannulated cows (594\\u2009±\\u200935.5\\xa0kg) were allocated randomly to 4 hay diets: low (L), medium low (ML), medium high (MH), and high (H) crude protein (CP) concentration (79, 111, 131, and 164\\xa0g CP/kg on a DM basis, respectively). Diets were offered in 3 periods with 2 diet replicates per period and were rotated across cows between periods. Cows were individually fed 20\\xa0g DM/kg of body weight in equal feedings at 08:00 and 16:00\\xa0h for a 10-d adaptation followed by a 5-d total fecal collection. Actual DM intake (DMI), DMD, and FO were determined based on hay offered, ort, and feces excreted. These components were then analyzed for ADL, APL, and ADIA concentration to determine marker recovery and marker-based estimates of FO and DMD.ResultsForage DMI was affected by diet (P =\\u20090.02), and DMI from MH and H was greater (P <\\u20090.05) than from L. Apparent DMD tended (P =\\u20090.08) to differ among diets while FO (P =\\u20090.20) was not affected by diet treatments. Average ADL recovery (1.16) was greater (P <\\u20090.05) than that of ADIA (1.03) and APL (1.06), but ADIA and APL did not differ (P =\\u20090.42). Estimates of FO and DMD derived using APL and ADIA were not different (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.05) from total fecal collection while those using ADL differed (P <\\u20090.05). There was no diet by marker interaction (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.22) for either FO or DMD.ConclusionAcid-detergent insoluble ash and APL accurately predicted FO and DMD of cattle fed bermudagrass hay of varying nutrient composition. These internal markers may facilitate studies involving large numbers of animals and forages. Results from such studies may be used to develop improved equations to predict energy values of forages based on the relationship of dietary components to digestibility across a wide range of forages.',\n",

The three treatments included 34.91% (B), 18.87% (BC), and 18.86% (BB) barley that in treatment B was partially replaced with only corn or corn plus beet pulp in treatments BC and BB, respectively. The concentration of starch and neutral detergent soluble carbohydrate varied (22.2, 20.2, and 14.5; 13.6, 15.9, and 20.1% of DM in treatments B, BC, and BB, respectively). Cows in treatment BB showed a higher DMI and improved digestibility of DM, NDF, and EE compared with treatments B or BC. Ruminal pH was higher in cows fed on BB (6.83) compared with those that received B or BC treatments (6.62 and 6.73, respectively). A lower proportion of propionate accompanied the higher pH in the BB group; however, a greater proportion of acetate and acetate: propionate ratio was observed compared with cows fed either on the B or BC diet. Moreover, cows fed on the BB diet showed the lowest ruminal passage rate and longest ruminal and total retention time. Eating time did not differ among treatments, rumination time was greater among cows fed on the BB diet compared with the others, whereas total chewing activity was greater than those fed on BC, but similar to those fed on B. The treatments showed no effect on milk yield. Partially replacing barley with corn or beet pulp resulted in an increase in milk fat and a lower protein concentration. Changing dietary NFC with that of a different degradability thus altered intake, chewing activity, ruminal environment, retention time or passage rate, and lactation performance. The results of this study showed that beet pulp with a higher NDF and a detergent-soluble carbohydrate or pectin established a more consistent ruminal mat than barley and corn, thus resulting in higher mean retention time and chewing activity, whereas no changes in 3.5% FCM and milk fat were observed.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundHematologic and biochemical reference intervals depend on many factors, including age. A review of the literature highlights the lack of reference intervals for 6-wk-old specific pathogen free (SPF) Hampshire-Yorkshire crossbred pigs. For translational research, 6-wk-old pigs represent an important animal model for both human juvenile colitis and diabetes mellitus type 2 given the similarities between the porcine and human gastrointestinal maturation process. The aim of this study was to determine reference intervals for hematological and biochemical parameters in healthy 6-wk-old crossbred pigs. Blood samples were collected from 66 clinically healthy Hampshire-Yorkshire pigs. The pigs were 6 wks old, represented both sexes, and were housed in a SPF facility. Automated hematological and biochemical analysis were performed using an ADVIA 120 Hematology System and a Cobas 6000 C501 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer.ResultsReference intervals were calculated using both parametric and nonparametric methods. The mean, median, minimum, and maximum values were calculated.ConclusionAs pigs are used more frequently as medical models of human disease, having reference intervals for commonly measured hematological and biochemical parameters in 6-wk-old pigs will be useful. The reference intervals calculated in this study will aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of both naturally occurring and experimentally induced disease. In comparison to published reference intervals for older non SPF pigs, notable differences in leukocyte populations, and in levels of sodium, potassium, glucose, protein, and alkaline phosphatase were observed.',\n",

However, the symptom of laying hens usually is not typical and hard to diagnosis. In the present study, it is studied that the influences of SE infection on layers’ performance, egg quality and blood biochemical indicators. It will help us to improve the strategy to control SE infection in commercial layers. One hundred layers at 20 wk of age were divided into 2 groups, 60 hens for experiment and others for control. The experiment group was fed with the dosage of 108\\xa0CFU SE per hen. The specific PCR was used to detect the deposition of SE. On the 8 d after SE infection, 10 hens from the control group and 30 hens from the experimental group were slaughtered to detect the SE colonization. The production performance, egg quality and blood biochemical indices were also analyzed.ResultsThe results showed that the colonization rate of SE was highest in caecum contents (55.17%) and lowest in vagina (17.24%). For the eggs the detection rate of SE was highest on the eggshell (80.00%) and lowest in yolk (18.81%). SE infection had no significant influence on production performance and egg qualities (P > 0.05). The difference of laying rate between the experimental and control groups was less than 0.30%, and both were approximately equal to 82.00%. The blood analysis showed that the aspartic aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of experimental group was significantly higher than those of control group (P < 0.05). For experimental and control groups AST values were 236.22 U/l and 211.84 U/l respectively, and ALT values were 32.19 U/l and 24.55 U/l. All of coefficients were less than 20%. The colonization of SE in organs increases the enzyme activities of AST and ALT in blood.ConclusionsSE in feed could invade the oviduct and infect the forming eggs. It significantly increased the concentration of ALT and AST in blood. However,SE infection was hard to be observed from the appearances of layer and egg. It might be a dangerous risk to human health.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundHeifers not used as breeding stock are often implanted with steroids to increase growth efficiency thereby altering hormone profiles and potentially changing the environment in which ovarian follicles develop. Because bovine granulosa cell culture is a commonly used technique and often bovine ovaries are collected from abattoirs with no record of implant status, the objective of this study was to determine if the presence of an implant during bovine granulosa cell development impacts follicle stimulating hormone-regulated steroidogenic enzyme expression. Paired ovaries were collected from 16 feedlot heifers subjected to 1 of 3 treatments: non-implanted (n\\u2009=\\u20095), Revalor 200 for 28 d (n\\u2009=\\u20095), or Revalor 200 for 84 d (n\\u2009=\\u20096). Small follicle (1 to 5\\xa0mm) granulosa cells were isolated from each pair and incubated with phosphate buffered saline (n\\u2009=\\u200916) or 100\\xa0ng/mL follicle stimulating hormone (n\\u2009=\\u200916) for 24\\xa0h.ResultsGranulosa cells of implanted heifers treated with follicle stimulating hormone produced medium concentrations of progesterone similar (P\\u2009=\\u20090.22) to non-implanted heifers, while medium estradiol concentrations were increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) at 28 and 84 d compared to non-implanted heifers indicating efficacy of treatment. Additionally, real-time PCR analysis in response to follicle stimulating hormone treatment demonstrated a decrease in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) mRNA expression in heifers implanted for 84 d and an increase in P450 side chain cleavage mRNA in granulosa cells of heifers implanted for 28 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) or 84 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared to non-implanted females. However, no difference in expression of 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.57) and aromatase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.23) were demonstrated in implanted or non-implanted heifers.ConclusionsThese results indicate follicles which develop in the presence of high concentrations of androgenic and estrogenic steroids via an implant tend to demonstrate an altered capacity to respond to follicle stimulating hormone stimulation. Thus, efforts should be made to avoid the use of implanted heifers to study steroidogenesis in small follicle granulosa cell culture systems.',\n",

The porcine versions of the enzymes were confirmed by real time PCR. Cytochrome 8b1 (CYP8B1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Aldh2), and thiosulfate transferase (TST) were all significantly stimulated.

With the rapid development of beverage industry, the resultant large amounts of tea grounds attract great attention. However, unreasonable utilization of tea grounds would lead to great waste and environmental pollution, especially in summer. In view of the high nutritive value and multiple functional components, tea grounds could be used as feedstuff. By now, researches of tea grounds as feedstuff are mainly on ruminant, as the utilization on other animals is limited to lower level due to high fiber content. Therefore, the following review will begin with a brief introduction of tea grounds and the possible utilization of tea grounds as feedstuff, and then elaborate on the application of ensiling and total mixed ration on ruminant. Apart from the fermentation quality, nutritive value is also provided to assess feasibilities of using tea grounds as feedstuff resources. Finally, a summary on the utilization situation and future direction of using tea grounds as feedstuff is provided in this review.',\n",

Because corn and soybean are staple food crops for humans, their common use as the main source of dietary energy and protein for food-producing animals directly competes with their allocation for human consumption. Alternatively, de-fatted marine microalgal biomass generated from the potential biofuel production may be a viable replacement of corn and soybean meal due to their high levels of protein, relatively well-balanced amino acid profiles, and rich contents of minerals and vitamins, along with unique bioactive compounds. Although the full-fatted (intact) microalgae represent the main source of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids including docohexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the de-fatted microalgal biomass may still contain good amounts of these components for enriching DHA/EPA in eggs, meats, and milk. This review is written to highlight the necessity and potential of using the de-fatted microalgal biomass as a new generation of animal feed in helping address the global energy, food, and environmental issues. Nutritional feasibility and limitation of the biomass as the new feed ingredient for simple-stomached species are elaborated. Potential applications of the biomass for generating value-added animal products are also explored.',\n",

The E. coli challenge reduced performance, increased goblet cell size and number in the ileum, increased bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to the lymph nodes, and increased ileal crypt depth. One of the clays (smectite A) tended to increase goblet cell size in ileum, which may indicate enhanced protection.

Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been used to replace antibiotics in the past two decades and played an increasingly important role in livestock production. The present study was carried out to assess the feeding effects of a traditional nourishing Chinese herbal medicine mixture on kinetics of plasma glucose, protein and energy metabolism in sheep. Ruminal fermentation characteristics were also determined.MethodsFour sheep were fed on either mixed hay (MH-diet) or MH-diet supplemented with 2% of Chinese herbal medicine (mixture of Astragalus root, Angelica root and Atractylodes rhizome; CHM-diet) over two 35-day periods using a crossover design. The turnover rate of plasma glucose was measured with an isotope dilution method using [U-13C]glucose. The rates of plasma leucine turnover and leucine oxidation, whole body protein synthesis (WBPS) and metabolic heat production were measured using the [1-13C]leucine dilution and open circuit calorimetry.ResultsBody weight gain of sheep was higher (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) for CHM-diet than for MH-diet. Rumen pH was lower (P\\u2009=\\u20090.02), concentration of rumen total volatile fatty acid tended to be higher (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) and acetate was higher (P\\u2009=\\u20090.04) for CHM-diet than for MH-diet. Turnover rates of plasma glucose and leucine did not differ between diets. Oxidation rate of leucine tended to be higher (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) for CHM-diet than for MH-diet, but the WBPS did not differ between diets. Metabolic heat production tended to be greater (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) for CHM-diet than for MH-diet.ConclusionsThe sheep fed on CHM-diet had a higher body weight gain and showed positive impacts on rumen fermentation and energy metabolism without resulting in any adverse response. Therefore, these results suggested that the Chinese herbal medicine mixture should be considered as a potential feed additive for sheep.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractDietary fiber, resistant to host-mediated digestion in the small intestine due to lack of endogenous enzymes, impacts many facets of animal health and is associated with gut development especially in young monogastrics. Furthermore, it can be used as in-feed antibiotic alternative. Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) forage with high content of pectin (uronic acids as building blocks) is a novel class of dietary fiber that is chemically different from cereal grains (with high content of arabinoxylans). In the present study, we investigated effects of dietary inclusion of chicory forage on digestibility, gut morphology and microbiota in broilers and young pigs. In the chicken experiment, 160 1-d old broiler chicks were fed 3 nutritionally balanced diets for 30 d including a cereal-based diet and 2 diets with part of the cereals substituted with 60 and 120\\xa0g/kg chicory forage (CF60 and CF120), whereas in the pig experiment, 18 seven-wk old Yorkshire pigs were fed 3 diets for 18 d including a cereal-based diet and 2 diets with 80 and 160\\xa0g/kg chicory forage inclusion (CF80 and CF160). Our results showed that young pigs were capable to utilize chicory forage well with higher total tract apparent digestibility (TTAD) of all fiber fractions, particularly uronic acid, compared with the control (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). In contrast, a decreased TTAD of all fiber fractions was observed in chickens fed on diet CF120 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Moreover, diet induced changes in gut morphology were observed in the large intestine of chickens. The alteration of cecal mucosal thickness was further positively correlated with TTAD of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and its constituent sugars (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, in pigs, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of intestinal microbiota revealed substantial dietary effects (cereal control diet vs. chicory forage inclusion) on the relative abundance of 2 dominant bacterial phylotypes (Prevotella sp. vs. Roseburia sp.) respectively (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In conclusion, our data showed that chicory forage (Cichorium intybus L.), a novel dietary fiber source in animal nutrition, have potential beneficial properties as fiber ingredient in diets for both pigs and chickens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundStudies have shown clear differences between dairy breeds in their feed intake and production efficiencies. The duodenum is critical in the coordination of digestion and absorption of nutrients. This study examined gene transcript abundance of important classes of nutrient transporters in the duodenum of non lactating dairy cows of different feed efficiency potential, namely Holstein-Friesian (HF), Jersey (JE) and their F1 hybrid. Duodenal epithelial tissue was collected at slaughter and stored at -80°C. Total RNA was extracted from tissue and reverse transcribed to generate cDNA. Gene expression of the following transporters, namely nucleoside; amino acid; sugar; mineral; and lipid transporters was measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Data were statistically analysed using mixed models ANOVA in SAS. Orthogonal contrasts were used to test for potential heterotic effects and spearman correlation coefficients calculated to determine potential associations amongst gene expression values and production efficiency variables.ResultsWhile there were no direct effects of genotype on expression values for any of the genes examined, there was evidence for a heterotic effect (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on ABCG8, in the form of increased expression in the F1 genotype compared to either of the two parent breeds. Additionally, a tendency for increased expression of the amino acid transporters, SLC3A1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.072), SLC3A2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.081) and SLC6A14 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.072) was also evident in the F1 genotype. A negative (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) association was identified between the expression of the glucose transporter gene SLC5A1 and total lactational milk solids yield, corrected for body weight. Positive correlations (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) were also observed between the expression values of genes involved in common transporter roles.ConclusionThis study suggests that differences in the expression of sterol and amino acid transporters in the duodenum could contribute towards the documented differences in feed efficiency between HF, JE and their F1 hybrid. Furthermore, positive associations between the expression of genes involved in common transporter roles suggest that these may be co-regulated. The study identifies potential candidates for investigation of genetic variants regulating nutrient transport and absorption in the duodenum in dairy cows, which may be incorporated into future breeding programmes.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundCorn silage is the main dietary component used for ruminant breeding in China and is an important dietary source of fatty acids for these animals. However, little is known regarding effective means to protect the fatty acid (FA) contents in silages. In this study, we examined the changes in FA contents and compositions during corn ensiling and screened several antioxidants for their inhibition of lipid oxidation during corn ensiling.MethodsWe conducted two different experiments. In Experiment 1, corn was ensiled in 30 polyethylene bottles (bottle volume: 1\\xa0L, silage density: 600\\xa0g/dm3) and three bottles were opened at 0.5 d, 1 d, 1.5 d, 2 d, 2.5 d, 3 d, 5 d, 7 d, 14 d, and 28 d after ensiling. In Experiment 2, corn was treated with various antioxidants: (1) No additives (CK); (2) BHA (Butylated hydroxyanisole); (3) TBHQ (Tertiary butyl hydroquinone); (4) TPP (Tea polyphenols); and (5) VE (Vitamin E). These treatments were applied at 50\\xa0mg/kg and 100\\xa0mg/kg of fresh weight with each treatment replicated 3 times.ResultsDuring ensiling in Experiment 1, saturated fatty acids (SFA; C16:0 and C18:0) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents tended to increase, whereas unsaturated fatty acids (UFA; C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3) tended to decrease. However, these changes were only significant on the first 2\\xa0days of ensiling. In Experiment 2, all of the antioxidants tested affected the total FA contents and those of unsaturated fatty acids (C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3) and MDA. The effects of TBHQ and TPP were greater than those of the other antioxidants.ConclusionsThe reduced total FA contents in corn silages were due to unsaturated fatty acids’ oxidation during the early stages of ensiling. Adding an antioxidant could prevent fatty acids’ oxidation in corn silages.',\n",

This also changed the fatty acid profile of omega-6: omega-3 from, 5 to 1 in the CON pork, to a ratio of 1.7 to 1 in DHA pork. The appearance, odor, oxidation rates and sensory taste, as judged by a trained panel, determined the DHA injected meat to be, 'slightly desirable’ and gave lower 'off flavour’ scores, relative to the CON and SF injected pork.

This study was conducted to evaluate basic cellular responses to a growth promotant implant at two intake levels.MethodsSixteen crossbred steers (293\\u2009±\\u200919.3\\xa0kg) were used to evaluate the impact of anabolic implants in either an adequate or a restricted nutritional state. Steers were trained to individual Calan gates, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement. Treatments consisted of: presence or absence of an anabolic growth implant (Revalor-XS, 200\\xa0mg TBA and 40\\xa0mg estradiol; IMPLANT or CONTROL) and a moderate energy, pelleted, starting cattle diet fed at either 2.0\\u2009×\\u2009or 1.0\\u2009×\\u2009maintenance energy (NEM) requirements (HIGH or LOW). Serum (d 0, 14, and 28) was used for application to bovine muscle satellite cells. After treatment with the serum (20% of total media) from the trial cattle, the satellite cells were incubated for 72\\xa0h. Protein abundance of myosin heavy chain (MHC), phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (phospho-ERK), and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (phospho-mTOR) were analyzed to determine the effects of implant, intake, and their interaction (applied via the serum).ResultsIntake had no effect on MHC (P =\\u20090.85) but IMPLANT increased (P <\\u20090.01) MHC abundance vs. CONTROL. Implant status, intake status, and the interaction had no effect on the abundance of phospho-ERK (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.23). Implanting increased phospho-mTOR (P <\\u20090.01) but there was no effect (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.51) of intake or intake\\u2009×\\u2009implant.ConclusionsThe nearly complete lack of interaction between implant and nutritional status indicates that the signaling molecules measured herein respond to implants and nutritional status independently. Furthermore, results suggest that the muscle hypertrophic effects of anabolic implants may not be mediated by circulating IGF-1.',\n",

The second objective was to develop regression equations that may be used to predict the concentration of SID AA in corn DDGS. A source of corn DDGS was divided into 4 batches that were either not autoclaved or autoclaved at 130°C for 10, 20, or 30\\xa0min. Four diets containing DDGS from each of the 4 batches were formulated with DDGS being the only source of AA and CP in the diets. A N-free diet also was formulated and used to determine the basal endogenous losses of CP and AA. Ten growing pigs (initial BW: 53.5\\u2009±\\u20093.9\\xa0kg) were surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a replicated 5\\u2009×\\u20094 Youden square design with 5 diets and 4 periods in each square. The SID of CP decreased linearly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) from 77.9% in non-autoclaved DDGS to 72.1, 66.1, and 68.5% in the DDGS samples that were autoclaved for 10, 20, or 30\\xa0min, respectively. The SID of lysine was quadratically reduced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) from 66.8% in the non-autoclaved DDGS to 54.9, 55.3, and 51.9% in the DDGS autoclaved for 10, 20, or 30\\xa0min, respectively. The concentrations of SID Arginine, Histidine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, or Threonine may be best predicted by equations that include the concentration of acid detergent insoluble N in the model (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.76, 0.68, 0.67, 0.84, 0.76, 0.73, or 0.54, respectively). The concentrations of SID Isoleucine and Valine were predicted (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.58 and 0.54, respectively) by the Lysine:CP ratio, whereas the concentration of SID Tryptophan was predicted (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.70) by the analyzed concentration of Tryptophan in DDGS. In conclusion, the SID of AA is decreased as a result of heat damage and the concentration of SID AA in heat-damaged DDGS may be predicted by regression equations developed in this experiment.',\n",

Excretion of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) of the experimental diets were determined.Due to the highest dietary fibre content, VN had the lowest digestibility of N, P and C (73, 49, and 73%, respectively) compared with the DK and TH pig diets. From the known diet composition using standard table values on chemical and nutrient digestibly, high accuracy (bias) and low variation was found and the results could be used for prediction on chemical composition and excretion in faeces and urine in growing pigs. Calculation based on standard values regarding nutrient retention in the pig body as used in the Danish manure normative system (DMNS) showed likewise to be quite useful for quantifying the total excretion of N and P.Overall, the results demonstrate that simple models that require cheap and normally available information on dietary nutrients can give useful information on nutrient excretion in growing pigs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundFat deposits in chickens contribute significantly to meat quality attributes such as juiciness, flavor, taste and other organoleptic properties. The quantity of fat deposited increases faster and earlier in the fast-growing chickens than in slow-growing chickens. In this study, Affymetrix Genechip® Chicken Genome Arrays 32773 transcripts were used to compare gene expression profiles in liver and hypothalamus tissues of fast-growing and slow-growing chicken at 8 wk of age. Real-time RT-PCR was used to validate the differential expression of genes selected from the microarray analysis. The mRNA expression of the genes was further examined in fat tissues. The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of four lipid-related genes with fat traits was examined in a F2 resource population.ResultsFour hundred genes in the liver tissues and 220 genes hypothalamus tissues, respectively, were identified to be differentially expressed in fast-growing chickens and slow-growing chickens. Expression levels of genes for lipid metabolism (SULT1B1, ACSBG2, PNPLA3, LPL, AOAH) carbohydrate metabolism (MGAT4B, XYLB, GBE1, PGM1, HKDC1) cholesttrol biosynthesis (FDPS, LSS, HMGCR, NSDHL, DHCR24, IDI1, ME1) HSD17B7 and other reaction or processes (CYP1A4, CYP1A1, AKR1B1, CYP4V2, DDO) were higher in the fast-growing White Recessive Rock chickens than in the slow-growing Xinghua chickens. On the other hand, expression levels of genes associated with multicellular organism development, immune response, DNA integration, melanin biosynthetic process, muscle organ development and oxidation-reduction (FRZB, DMD, FUT8, CYP2C45, DHRSX, and CYP2C18) and with glycol-metabolism (GCNT2, ELOVL 6, and FASN), were higher in the XH chickens than in the fast-growing chickens. RT-PCR validated high expression levels of nine out of 12 genes in fat tissues. The G1257069A and T1247123C of the ACSBG2 gene were significantly associated with abdominal fat weight. The G4928024A of the FASN gene were significantly associated with fat bandwidth, and abdominal fat percentage. The C4930169T of the FASN gene was associated with abdominal fat weight while the A59539099G of the ELOVL 6 was significantly associated with subcutaneous fat. The A8378815G of the DDT was associated with fat band width.ConclusionThe differences in fat deposition were reflected with differential gene expressions in fast and slow growing chickens.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"AbstractBackgroundThe use of equine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) is a novel method to improve fracture healing in horses. However, additional research is needed to identify optimal culture conditions and to determine the mechanisms involved in regulating BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts. The objectives of the experiments were to determine: 1) if autologous or commercial serum is better for proliferation and differentiation of equine BMSC into osteoblasts, and 2) the expression of key transcription factors during the differentiation of equine BMSC into osteoblasts. Equine BMSC were isolated from the sterna of 3 horses, treated with purchased fetal bovine serum (FBS) or autologous horse serum (HS), and cell proliferation determined. To induce osteoblast differentiation, cells were incubated with L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate and glycerol-2-phosphate in the presence or absence of human bone morphogenetic protein2 (BMP2), dexamethasone (DEX), or combination of the two. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a marker of osteoblast differentiation, was determined by ELISA. Total RNA was isolated from differentiating BMSC between d 0 to 18 to determine expression of runt-related transcription factor2 (Runx2), osterix (Osx), and T-box3 (Tbx3). Data were analyzed by ANOVA.ResultsRelative to control, FBS and HS increased cell number (133\\u2009±\\u20095 and 116\\u2009±\\u20095%, respectively; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (167\\u2009±\\u20096 and 120\\u2009±\\u20096%, respectively; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Treatment with DEX increased ALP activity compared with control (1,638\\u2009±\\u200938%; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In the absence and presence of Dex, BMP-2 did not alter ALP activity (P\\u2009>\\u20090.8). Runt-related transcription factor2 expression increased 3-fold (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) by d 6 of culture. Osterix expression increased 9-fold (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by d 18 of culture. Expression of Tbx3 increased 1.8-fold at d 3 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01); however expression was reduced 4-fold at d 18 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).ConclusionsDexamethasone, but not BMP-2, is required for differentiation of equine BMSC into osteoblasts. In addition, expression of Runx2 and osterix increased and expression of Tbx3 is reduced during differentiation.\",\n",

In order to better understand the endometrium involved mechanisms of implantation, we used LC-MS/MS technique to profile the proteome of ovine endometrial C areas and IC areas separately during the peri-implantation period, and then compared the proteomic profiles between these two areas.

Our study, for the first time, provided a proteomic reference for elucidating the differences between C and IC areas, as an integrated function unit respectively, during the peri-implantation period. The results could help us to better understand the implantation in the ewes.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIn 2012, genetically engineered (GE) crops were grown by 17.3 million farmers on over 170 million hectares. Over 70% of harvested GE biomass is fed to food producing animals, making them the major consumers of GE crops for the past 15 plus years. Prior to commercialization, GE crops go through an extensive regulatory evaluation. Over one hundred regulatory submissions have shown compositional equivalence, and comparable levels of safety, between GE crops and their conventional counterparts. One component of regulatory compliance is whole GE food/feed animal feeding studies. Both regulatory studies and independent peer-reviewed studies have shown that GE crops can be safely used in animal feed, and rDNA fragments have never been detected in products (e.g. milk, meat, eggs) derived from animals that consumed GE feed. Despite the fact that the scientific weight of evidence from these hundreds of studies have not revealed unique risks associated with GE feed, some groups are calling for more animal feeding studies, including long-term rodent studies and studies in target livestock species for the approval of GE crops. It is an opportune time to review the results of such studies as have been done to date to evaluate the value of the additional information obtained. Requiring long-term and target animal feeding studies would sharply increase regulatory compliance costs and prolong the regulatory process associated with the commercialization of GE crops. Such costs may impede the development of feed crops with enhanced nutritional characteristics and durability, particularly in the local varieties in small and poor developing countries. More generally it is time for regulatory evaluations to more explicitly consider both the reasonable and unique risks and benefits associated with the use of both GE plants and animals in agricultural systems, and weigh them against those associated with existing systems, and those of regulatory inaction. This would represent a shift away from a GE evaluation process that currently focuses only on risk assessment and identifying ever diminishing marginal hazards, to a regulatory approach that more objectively evaluates and communicates the likely impact of approving a new GE plant or animal on agricultural production systems.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundMany studies have investigated endogenous loss of proteins and amino acids (AAs) at the ileal level in growing pigs. However, only a few studies have researched this subject in piglets. Knowledge regarding AA ileal digestibility in piglets would be helpful during the formulation of diets for weaning piglets, rather than just using coefficients obtained in growing pigs. Therefore, in this study, we sought to estimate endogenous protein and AA ileal losses in piglets. Furthermore, apparent and true ileal digestibility (AID and TID) of protein and AAs from casein were measured.ResultsThe average flow of protein was 20.8\\xa0g/kg of dry matter intake (DMI). Basal protein loss, as estimated by regression, was 16.9\\xa0g/kg DMI. Glutamic acid, arginine, and aspartic acid (2.2, 1.4, and 1.2\\xa0g/kg DMI, respectively) were the AAs for which greater losses were seen. The AID of protein and AAs increased as the protein level in the diet increased. A higher increment in AID was observed between diets with 80 and160 g CP/kg of feed; this finding was mainly attributable to increases in glycine and arginine (46.1% and 18%, respectively). The TID of protein was 97.8, and the TID of AAs varied from 93.9 for histidine to 100.2 for phenylalanine.ConclusionsThe basal endogenous protein loss in piglets was 16.9\\xa0g/kg DMI. Endogenous protein was rich in glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and arginine, which represented 32.7% of endogenous protein loss in weaning piglets. The TID of casein was high and varied from 93.0 for histidine to 100.2 for phenylalanine.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIn the past two decades, an intensive amount of research has been focused on the development of alternatives to antibiotics to maintain swine health and performance. The most widely researched alternatives include probiotics, prebiotics, acidifiers, plant extracts and neutraceuticals such as copper and zinc. Since these additives have been more than adequately covered in previous reviews, the focus of this review will be on less traditional alternatives. The potential of antimicrobial peptides, clay minerals, egg yolk antibodies, essential oils, eucalyptus oil-medium chain fatty acids, rare earth elements and recombinant enzymes are discussed. Based on a thorough review of the literature, it is evident that a long and growing list of compounds exist which have been tested for their ability to replace antibiotics as feed additives in diets fed to swine. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these compounds produce inconsistent results and rarely equal antibiotics in their effectiveness. Therefore, it would appear that research is still needed in this area and that the perfect alternative to antibiotics does not yet exist.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundPlay behavior has been proposed as a new potential indicator of animal welfare. Animals play only if they are in a relaxed state. Play may improve adaptability to challenging environments which may be of interest in the breeding objective. Little information is available on play behavior in livestock species. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether play behavior in post-weaned piglets can be induced instantly in the presence of additional space and whether play markers are body weight, sex, and litter dependent. It is investigated whether playfulness is elicited by the moment or if this measure is consistent over different days.MethodsThirty two piglets from four litters were released into a corridor and video recorded for eight min at 37, 41, 44 and 48 d of age. The first test was considered as an adjustment period and was not included in the analysis. In the second to the fourth test, joyful brusque movements (jumping, turning and running) were recorded with a camera and total number of movements (JOY#) and total time (JOYtime) were estimated individually. Animals were weighed at 41 d of age.ResultsFemales had higher scores of JOY# and JOYtime than males but this was significant only for JOY# at 41 d of age (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The effect of age was highly significant both for JOY# and JOYtime (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Animals with a higher JOY# and JOYtime also expressed a higher JOY# and JOYtime in the other tests, but this was significant only between 44 and 48 d of age (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Body weight at 41 d of age was not significantly related to JOY# and JOYtime in any of the tests.ConclusionsLocomotor play was induced instantly by the provision of increased space allowance. Litter origin had a significant effect on play behavior. In addition, locomotor play scores were consistent between two of the three tests.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe availability of local feed resources in various seasons can contribute as essential sources of carbohydrate and protein which significantly impact rumen fermentation and the subsequent productivity of the ruminant. Recent developments, based on enriching protein in cassava chips, have yielded yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) providing up to 47.5% crude protein (CP), which can be used to replace soybean meal. The use of fodder trees has been developed through the process of pelleting; Leucaena leucocephala leaf pellets (LLP), mulberry leaf pellets (MUP) and mangosteen peel and/or garlic pellets, can be used as good sources of protein to supplement ruminant feeding. Apart from producing volatile fatty acids and microbial proteins, greenhouse gases such as methane are also produced in the rumen. Several methods have been used to reduce rumen methane. However, among many approaches, nutritional manipulation using feed formulation and feeding management, especially the use of plant extracts or plants containing secondary compounds (condensed tannins and saponins) and plant oils, has been reported. This approach could help todecrease rumen protozoa and methanogens and thus mitigate the production of methane. At present, more research concerning this burning issue - the role of livestock in global warming - warrants undertaking further research with regard to economic viability and practical feasibility.',\n",

Eight Holstein-Friesian cows were fed four diets during four successive17-day periods: 1) total mixed ration (TMR) containing 0% finely ground wheat (FGW) (W0); 2) TMR containing 10% FGW (W10); 3) TMR containing 20% FGW (W20); and 4) TMR containing 10% BP as a replacement for 10% ground corn (BP10). The SARA induction protocol reduced the mean ruminal pH from 6.37 to 5.94, and the minimum ruminal pH decreased from 5.99 to 5.41 from baseline to challenge period. Mean ruminal pH increased from 5.94 to 6.05, and minimum daily ruminal pH increased from 5.41 to 5.63, when BP was substituted for corn. The apparent digestibility of nutrients was not affected by the dietary treatments, except that the digestibility of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) was reduced in cows fed the W20 diet compared with cows fed the W0 and W10 diets, and cows fed the BP10 diet had higher NDF and ADF digestibility than the cows fed the W20 diet. Cows fed the W20 diet had a lower plasma concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), cholesterol, triglyceride, and total antioxidative capacity (TAC), and a higher plasma concentration of glucose, insulin, malonaldehyde (MDA), super oxygen dehydrogenises (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) than cows fed the W0 diet. Substitution of BP for corn increased concentrations of plasma BHBA and TAC, but decreased concentrations of plasma MDA. Our results indicate that reduction of fibre digestion; the concomitant increase of plasma glucose and insulin; the decrease of plasma BHBA, NEFA, cholesterol, and triglyceride; and changes of plasma oxidative stress parameters are highly related to SARA induced by W20 diets. These variables may be alternative candidates for SARA diagnosis. We also suggest that the substitution of BP for corn could reduce the risk of SARA, increase fibre digestion, and improve the antioxidant status in dairy cows.',\n",

Results from Monte Carlo computer simulations show that the newly developed E.M. algorithm is accurate if true recombination fraction is 0 even for single families of relatively small sizes. Estimates of recombination fraction and linkage disequilibrium were 0.00 (SD 0.00) and 0.19 (SD 0.03) for simulated recombination fraction and linkage disequilibrium of 0.00 and 0.20, respectively. A genome fragmentation phasing strategy was developed and used for phasing haplotypes in a sire and 36 progeny using the 50 k Illumina BeadChip by: a) estimation of the recombination fraction and LD in consecutive SNPs using family information, b) linkage analyses between fragments, c) phasing of haplotypes in parents and progeny and in following generations. Homozygous SNPs in progeny allowed determination of paternal fragment inheritance, and deduction of SNP sequence information of haplotypes from dams. The strategy also allowed detection of genotyping errors. A total of 613 recombination events were detected after linkage analysis was carried out between fragments. Hot and cold spots were identified at the individual (sire level). SNPs for which the sire and calf were heterozygotes became informative (over 90%) after the phasing of haplotypes. Average of regions of identity between half-sibs when comparing its maternal inherited haplotypes (with at least 20 SNP) in common was 0.11 with a maximum of 0.29 and a minimum of 0.05. A Monte-Carlo simulation of BTA1 with the same linkage disequilibrium structure and genetic linkage as the cattle family yielded a 99.98 and 99.94% of correct phases for informative SNPs in sire and calves, respectively.',\n",

Litters (N\\u2009=\\u2009120) were allotted to four treatments during 14–21 d of lactation: 1) No creep feed (NC, n\\u2009=\\u200945); 2) creep fed control diet (CFCD, n\\u2009=\\u200945); 3) creep fed 1% GLN (CFGLN, n\\u2009=\\u200915); 4) creep fed .88% AG (CFAG, n\\u2009=\\u200915). After weaning, the NC and CFCD groups were sub-divided into three groups (n\\u2009=\\u200915 each), receiving either a control nursery diet (NC-CD, CFCD-CD) or a diet supplemented with either GLN (NC-GLN, CFCD-GLN) or with AG (NC-AG, CFCD-AG). Litters that were creep fed with diets containing GLN or AG also were supplemented with those amino acids in the nursery diets (CFGLN-GLN, CFAG-AG). Glutamine was added at 1% in all three post-weaning diet phases and AG was added at .88% in phase 1 and 2 and at .66% in phase 3.ResultsFeed conversion (feed/gain) showed means among treatment means close to significance (P\\u2009=\\u20090.056) and Tukey’s test for pairwise mean comparisons showed that Pigs in the CFGLN-GLN group had the best feed conversion (feed/gain) in the first three-week period post-weaning, exceeding (P\\u2009=\\u20090.044) controls (CFCD-CD) by 34%. The NC-AG group had (P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) the greatest feed intake in the last three week of the study, exceeding controls (CFCD-CD) by 12%. CFGLN-GLN, CFCD-GLN and sow reared (SR) pigs had the greatest (P\\u2009=\\u20090.049) villi height exceeding the CFCD-AG group by 18%, 20% and 19% respectively. The CFAG-AG group had the deepest (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) crypts among all treatments. CFGLN-GLN, CFCD-GLN and SR groups had the greatest (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) number of cells proliferating (PCNA) exceeding those in the NC-CD group by 43%, 54% and 63% respectively. Sow reared pigs showed the greatest (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) intestinal absorption capacity for xylose and mannitol.ConclusionSupplementation of creep feed and nursery diets with GLN and/or AminoGut in the first three week improved feed conversion possibly due to improved intestinal health.',\n",

Isolated chicken pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells were subjected to hypoxia or normoxia for indicated time points. Cell viability, DNA synthesis, cell cycle profile, and expression of E2F1 were analyzed. The results showed that hypoxia promoted cell proliferation and DNA synthesis which was accompanied by an increased S phase entry and upregulation of E2F1 at mRNA and protein levels. Using siRNA technology, we demonstrated that gene inactivation of endogenous E2F1 abolished hypoxia-induced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and S phase entry compared with negative siRNA transfected cells. These results suggest that hypoxia-induced proliferation is mediated by inducing E2F1 in chicken pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe intestine and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are essential components of whole body immune defense, protecting the body from foreign antigens and pathogens, while allowing tolerance to commensal bacteria and dietary antigens. The requirement for protein to support the immune system is well established. Less is known regarding the immune modifying properties of individual amino acids, particularly on the GALT. Both oral and parenteral feeding studies have established convincing evidence that not only the total protein intake, but the availability of specific dietary amino acids (in particular glutamine, glutamate, and arginine, and perhaps methionine, cysteine and threonine) are essential to optimizing the immune functions of the intestine and the proximal resident immune cells. These amino acids each have unique properties that include, maintaining the integrity, growth and function of the intestine, as well as normalizing inflammatory cytokine secretion and improving T-lymphocyte numbers, specific T cell functions, and the secretion of IgA by lamina propria cells. Our understanding of this area has come from studies that have supplemented single amino acids to a mixed protein diet and measuring the effect on specific immune parameters. Future studies should be designed using amino acid mixtures that target a number of specific functions of GALT in order to optimize immune function in domestic animals and humans during critical periods of development and various disease states.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractHumans and animals are in regular and at times close contact in modern intensive farming systems. The quality of human-animal interactions can have a profound impact on the productivity and welfare of farm animals. Interactions by humans may be neutral, positive or negative in nature. Regular pleasant contact with humans may result in desirable alterations in the physiology, behaviour, health and productivity of farm animals. On the contrary, animals that were subjected to aversive human contact were highly fearful of humans and their growth and reproductive performance could be compromised. Farm animals are particularly sensitive to human stimulation that occurs early in life, while many systems of the animals are still developing. This may have long-lasting impact and could possibly modify their genetic potential. The question as to how human contact can have a positive impact on responses to stressors, and productivity is not well understood. Recent work in our laboratory suggested that pleasant human contact may alter ability to tolerate various stressors through enhanced heat shock protein (hsp) 70 expression. The induction of hsp is often associated with increased tolerance to environmental stressors and disease resistance in animals. The attitude and consequent behaviour of stockpeople affect the animals’ fear of human which eventually influence animals’ productivity and welfare. Other than attitude and behaviour, technical skills, knowledge, job motivation, commitment and job satisfaction are prerequisites for high job performance.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMaternal recognition of pregnancy refers to the requirement for the conceptus (embryo and its associated extra-embryonic membranes) to produce a hormone that acts on the uterus and/or corpus luteum (CL) to ensure maintenance of a functional CL for production of progesterone; the hormone required for pregnancy in most mammals. The pregnancy recognition signal in primates is chorionic gonadotrophin which acts directly on the CL via luteinizing hormone receptors to ensure maintenance of functional CL during pregnancy. In ruminants, interferon tau (IFNT) is the pregnancy recognition signal. IFNT is secreted during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy and acts on uterine epithelia to silence expression of estrogen receptor alpha and oxytocin receptor which abrogates the oxytocin-dependent release of luteolytic pulses of prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF) by uterine epithelia; therefore, the CL continues to produce progesterone required for pregnancy. Pig conceptuses secrete interferon delta and interferon gamma during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy, but there is no evidence that they are involved in pregnancy recognition signaling. Rather, pig conceptuses secrete abundant amounts of estrogens between Days 11 to 15 of pregnancy required for maternal recognition of pregnancy. Estrogen, likely in concert with prolactin, prevents secretion of PGF into the uterine venous drainage (endocrine secretion), but maintains secretion of PGF into the uterine lumen (exocrine secretion) where it is metabolized to a form that is not luteolytic. Since PGF is sequestered within the uterine lumen and unavailable to induce luteolysis, functional CL are maintained for production of progesterone. In addition to effects of chorionic gonadotrophin, IFNT and estrogens to signal pregnancy recognition, these hormones act on uterine epithelia to enhance expression of genes critical for growth and development of the conceptus.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIn mammals, leptin is an attractive candidate for mediating the metabolic signal and the reproductive function via the specific receptor in hypothalamus. However, till now, the role of leptin on reproduction in birds is less well established. This experiment was conducted to elucidate the role of leptin on the onset of reproduction in bird, as a first step, to detect the changes of peripheral leptin and leptin receptor mRNA expression in hypothalamus between mature and immature hens at the same age. 120 ISA brown pullets at D60 were allocated randomly into two groups, long light (LL) group being raised under artificial light regimes with incrementally increased light phase (from 8\\xa0L:16D to 14\\xa0L:12D) and short light (SL) group raised on consistent light (8\\xa0L:16D) for 12 wk.ResultsThe results showed that pullets in LL group reached sexual maturation 15\\xa0d earlier than those in SL group. Serum E2 showed a significant increase with age, but no difference was observed between two groups. Serum leptin concentration decreased significantly from D112 to D136 in LL, and was markedly higher in LL group than that in SL at D112, while there was no significant difference between two groups at D136. Leptin receptor and GnRH-I mRNA expression in hypothalamus were significantly increased with age, yet there was no significant difference between SL and LL chickens at the same age. The expression of FSH-β and LH-β mRNA in pituitary was increased with age but did not show significant difference between LL and SL group. GnRH-I mRNA expression was very rich in pineal gland, and decreased from D112 to D136 in LL but not in SL group, and there was no difference between two groups at the same age.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the earlier sexual maturation in hens induced by long-light regime is not accompanied with an increase in serum leptin or leptin receptor gene expression in hypothalamus, or genes expression in HPG axis.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundIncreasing the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and decreasing the saturated fatty acid (SFA) content of mutton can help to improve its nutritional value for consumers. Several laboratories have evaluated the effects of vitamin E on the fatty acid (FA) composition of muscle in sheep. However, little information is available on wool sheep, even though wool sheep breeds are an important source of mutton, especially in northern China where sheep are extensively farmed. The present study was designed to address the effects of vitamin E on muscle FA composition in male Aohan fine-wool sheep.MethodsForty-two male Aohan fine-wool lambs (5 mo old) with similar initial body weight were randomly divided into seven groups and fed diets supplemented with 0 (control group), 20, 100, 200, 1,000, 2,000, or 2,400 IU/sheep/d vitamin E for 12 mo. Three lambs from each group were slaughtered to measure vitamin E and FA content in the longissimus lumborum (LL) and gluteus medius (GM) muscles.ResultsVitamin E concentrations in the LL and GM increased significantly after 12 mo of vitamin E supplementation (P < 0.05). However, this increase did not occur in a dose-dependent manner because the muscle vitamin E concentration was highest in the 200 IU/sheep/d group. Dietary vitamin E supplementation also caused a significant reduction in SFA content and an increase in monounsaturated FA (MUFA) content in the LL and GM (P < 0.05). All six doses of vitamin E significantly increased cis 9 trans 11-conjugated linoleic acid (c 9t 11-CLA) content in the LL compared with the control group (P < 0.05).ConclusionsDietary supplementation with vitamin E increased muscle vitamin E content and improved the nutritional value of mutton by decreasing SFA content and increasing MUFA and c 9t 11-CLA contents in Aohan fine-wool sheep. These effects were greatest in sheep fed a diet containing 200 IU/sheep/d vitamin E.',\n",

The process of weaning is one of the most stressful events in the pig’s life that can contribute to intestinal and immune system dysfunctions that result in reduced pig health, growth, and feed intake, particularly during the first week after weaning. Technological improvements in housing, nutrition, health, and management have been used to minimize some of the adverse effects of weaning stress, but a greater understanding of the biological impact of stress is needed to improve strategies to overcome weaning stress. The focus of this review paper is to briefly describe how the biological stress associated with weaning impacts intestinal morphology, structure, physiology, and intestinal immune responses that can impact subsequent production efficiencies such as growth, intake, morbidity, and mortality.',\n",

This experiment was conducted to determine the effects of fractionation of wheat DDGS on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and performance when fed to broiler chicks (0–21 d).MethodsA total of 150, day-old, male broiler chicks (Ross-308 line; Lilydale Hatchery, Wynyard, Saskatchewan) weighing an average of 49.6 ± 0.8 g were assigned to one of five dietary treatments in a completely randomized design. The control diet was based on wheat and soybean meal and contained 20% regular wheat DDGS. The experimental diets contained 5, 10, 15 or 20% fractionated wheat DDGS added at the expense of regular wheat DDGS.ResultsThe ATTD of dry matter and gross energy were linearly increased (P < 0.01) as the level of fractionated wheat DDGS in the diet increased. Nitrogen retention was unaffected by level of fractionated wheat DDGS (P > 0.05). Weight gain increased linearly (P = 0.05) as the level of fractionated wheat DDGS in the diet increased. Feed intake, feed conversion and mortality were unaffected by level of fractionated wheat DDGS in the diet (P > 0.05).ConclusionsPost-production fractionation of wheat DDGS improves their nutritional value by lowering their fiber content and increasing their content of crude protein and energy.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractArginine (ARG) exerts many beneficial effects on animal body and enhanced angiogenesis, lactogenesis, which finally leads to the improvement in nitrogen (N) metabolism, reproduction, lactation, immunity and growth. Unfortunately, unprotected ARG will be degraded in the rumen and its price is high, thus feeding rumen-protected ARG seems to be uneconomical. Alternatively, N-carbamoyl glutamate (NCG) is structural analogue of N-acetyl glutamate, cofactor of cabamoyl phosphate synthetase1, is lower in rumen degradation compared to ARG. Additionally, rumen epithelial and duodenal cells have potentially utilized the NCG for ureagenesis. Supplementation of NCG to high yielding dairy cows increased plasma concentration of ARG and nitric oxide, decreased the plasma ammonia N and improved lactation performance and N utilization. Supplementation of NCG enhanced pregnancy rates in rats, improved litter size and fetal survival rate, thereby improved the reproductive performance of sows. Oral NCG supplementation increases plasma ARG and somatotropin levels, and increased growth rate and muscle protein synthesis in nursing piglets. The NCG is potential a relatively cheaper source of feed additive to offer vital compensation over oral administration of ARG, resulting in improved ruminant animal health and production. In this article, we reviewed the mechanism of ARG biosynthesis by NCG and their significance in growth, reproduction, milk production and N utilization in ruminant animals.',\n",

The villus length and V/C of ileum were significantly increased by the addition of BM or XG. XG improved the activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin and amylase, BM improved the activity of trypsin at 21d, and AG improved the activity of chymotrypsin at 21d. Comparing to PC diet, the addition of enzymes in PC or NC diet decreased feed cost per kg body weight gain especially in NC diet (except AG in PC diet) with the highest profits for XG in NC diet. In conclusion, supplementation of 0.02% BM or 0.01% AG or 0.05% XG could improve feed conversion of broilers in corn-soybean meal diet by improving energy utilization and digestive physiology, and also supplementation of 0.05% XG had a preferable efficacy in low energy diet.',\n",

The unique intra-chromosomal recombination pattern of Y chromosome and morphological difference of this chromosome between Bos taurus and Bos indicus make it an ideal model for studying structural variation, especially in crossbred (Bos taurus\\u2009×\\u2009Bos indicus) bulls. Copy Number Variation (CNV) is a type of genomic structural variation that gives information complementary to SNP data. The purpose of this study was to find out copy number differences of four Y chromosomal spermatogenesis-related candidate genes in genomic DNA of crossbred and purebred Indicine bulls.ResultFour Y chromosomal candidate genes of spermatogenesis namely, sex determining gene on Y chromosome (SRY), DEAD box polypeptide 3-Y chromosome (DDX3Y), Ubiquitin specific peptidase 9, Y-linked (USP9Y), testis-specific protein on Y chromosome (TSPY) were evaluated. Absolute copy numbers of Y chromosomal genes were determined by standard curve-based quantitative real time PCR. Copy numbers of SRY and TSPY genes per unit amount of genomic DNA are higher in crossbred than Indicine bulls. However, no difference was observed in DDX3Y and USP9Y gene copy numbers between two groups.ConclusionThe present study demonstrates that the structural organization of Y chromosomes differs between crossbred and Indicine bulls which are reproductively healthy as observed from analysis of semen attributes. The absolute copy numbers of SRY and TSPY genes in unit mass of genomic DNA of crossbred bulls are significantly higher than Indicine bulls. No alteration in absolute copies of DDX3Y and USP9Y gene was found between the genome of crossbred and Indicine bulls. This study suggests that the DDX3Y and USP9Y are likely to be single copy genes in the genome of crossbred and Indicine bulls and variation in Y chromosome length between crossbred and Indicine bulls may be due to the copy number variation of SRY gene and TSPY array.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is essential for mitosis and plays an important role in the regulation of microtubule assembly during oocyte meiotic maturation in mice; however, little is known about its role in porcine oocytes.ResultTotal p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and phosphorylated PAK1 at Thr423 (PAK1Thr423) were consistently expressed in porcine oocytes from the germinal vesicle (GV) to the second metaphase (MII) stages, but phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (H3Ser10) was only expressed after the GV stage. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PAK1Thr423 and H3Ser10 colocalized on chromosomes after the GV stage. Blocking of endogenous PAK1Thr423 by injecting a specific antibody decreased the phosphorylation level of H3Ser10; however, it had no impact on chromatin condensation, meiotic progression, cleavage rate of blastomeres or the rate of blastocyst formation.ConclusionPhosphorylation of PAK1Thr423 is a spontaneous activation process and the activated PAK1Thr423 can promote the phosphorylation of H3Ser10; however, this pathway is not required for meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes or early embryonic development.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundProduction of chimeric mice is a useful tool for the elucidation of gene function. After successful isolation of embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, there are many methods for producing chimeras, including co-culture with the embryos, microinjection of the ES cells into pre-implantation embryos, and use of tetraploid embryos to generate the full ES-derived transgenic mice. Here, we aimed to generate the transgenic ES cell line, compare the production efficiency of chimeric mice and its proportion to yield the male chimeric mice by microinjected ES cells into 4- to 8-cell and blastocysts embryos with the application of Piezo-Micromanipulator (PMM), and trace the fate of the injected ES cells.ResultsWe successfully generated a transgenic ES cell line and proved that this cell line still maintained pluripotency. Although we achieved a satisfactory chimeric mice rate, there was no significant difference in the production of chimeric mice using the two different methods, but the proportion of the male chimeric mice in the 4- to 8-cell group was higher than in the blastocyst group. We also found that there was no tendency for ES cells to aggregate into the inner cell mass using in vitro culture of the chimeric embryos, indicating that they aggregated randomly.ConclusionsThese results showed that the PMM method is a convenient way to generate chimeric mice and microinjection of ES cells into 4- to 8-cell embryos can increase the chance of yielding male chimeras compared to the blastocyst injection. These results provide useful data in transgenic research mediated by ES cells.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractApplication of feed processing methods and use of exogenous feed additives in an effort to improve nutrient digestibility of plant-based feed ingredients for swine has been studied for decades. The following review will discuss several of these topics, including: fiber characterization, impact of dietary fiber on gastrointestinal physiology, energy, and nutrient digestibility, mechanical processing of feed on fiber and energy digestibility, and the use of exogenous enzymes in diets fed to growing pigs. Taken together, the diversity and concentration of chemical characteristics that exists among plant-based feed ingredients, as well as interactions among constituents within feed ingredients and diets, suggests that improvements in nutrient digestibility and pig performance from mechanical processing or adding exogenous enzymes to diets fed to swine depends on a better understanding of these characteristics, but also relating enzyme activity to targeted substrates. It may be that an enzyme must not only match a target substrate(s), but there may also need to be a ′cocktail′ of enzymes to effectively breakdown the complex matrixes of fibrous carbohydrates, such that the negative impact of these compounds on nutrient digestibility or voluntary feed intake are alleviated. With the inverse relationship between fiber content and energy digestibility being well described for several feed ingredients, it is only logical that development of processing techniques or enzymes that degrade fiber, and thereby improve energy digestibility or voluntary feed intake, will be both metabolically and economically beneficial to pork production.',\n",

Several studies showed that pigs were independently domesticated in multiple regions of the world. The purpose of this study was to investigate the origin and evolution of Chinese pigs using complete mitochondrial genomic sequences (mtDNA) from Asian and European domestic pigs and wild boars. Thirty primer pairs were designed to determine the mtDNA sequences of Xiang pig, Large White, Lantang, Jinhua and Pietrain. The phylogenetic status of Chinese native pigs was investigated by comparing the mtDNA sequences of complete coding regions and D-loop regions respectively amongst Asian breeds, European breeds and wild boars. The analyzed results by two cluster methods contributed to the same conclusion that all pigs were classified into two major groups, European clade and Asian clade. It revealed that Chinese pigs were only recently diverged from each other and distinctly different from European pigs. Berkshire was clustered with Asian pigs and Chinese pigs were involved in the development of Berkshire breeding. The Malaysian wild boar had distant genetic relationship with European and Asian pigs. Jinhua and Lanyu pigs had more nucleotide diversity with Chinese pigs although they all belonged to the Asian major clade. Chinese domestic pigs were clustered with wild boars in Yangtze River region and South China.',\n",

In Exp. 1 and 2, pigs were randomly allotted to 6 dietary treatments using a randomized complete block design and a balanced 2 period changeover design, respectively. In both experiments, 6 diets were formulated. The positive control diet was a corn-soybean meal diet with added inorganic phosphorus (Exp. 1: 0.42 and 0.86% standardized total tract digestible phosphorus and total calcium, respectively; Exp. 2: 0.32 and 0.79% standardized total tract digestible phosphorus and total calcium, respectively). A negative control diet and 4 diets with the novel phytase (Ronozyme HiPhos, DSM Nutritional Products Inc., Parsippany, NJ) added to the negative control diet at levels of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 phytase units (FYT)/kg were also formulated. In Exp. 1, the ATTD of phosphorus was greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) for the positive control diet (60.5%) than for the negative control diet (40.5%), but increased (linear and quadratic, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) as phytase was added to the negative control diet (40.5% vs. 61.6%, 65.1%, 68.7%, and 68.0%). The breakpoint for the ATTD of phosphorus (68.4%) was reached at a phytase inclusion level of 1,016 FYT/kg. In Exp. 2, the ATTD of phosphorus was greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) for the positive control diet (59.4%) than for the negative control diet (39.8%) and increased (linear and quadratic, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) as phytase was added to the negative control diet (39.8% vs. 58.1%, 65.4%, 69.1%, and 72.8%). The breakpoint for the ATTD of phosphorus (69.1%) was reached at a phytase inclusion level of 801 FYT/kg. In conclusion, the novel bacterial 6-phytase improved the ATTD of phosphorus and calcium in both weanling and growing pigs. The optimum level of inclusion for this phytase is 800 to 1,000 FYT/kg of complete feed to maximize ATTD of phosphorus and calcium in weanling and growing pigs.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractProtein is quantitatively the most expensive nutrient in swine diets. Hence it is imperative to understand the physiological roles played by amino acids in growth, development, lactation, reproduction, and health of pigs to improve their protein nutrition and reduce the costs of pork production. Due to incomplete knowledge of amino acid biochemistry and nutrition, it was traditionally assumed that neonatal, post-weaning, growing-finishing, and gestating pigs could synthesize sufficient amounts of all \"nutritionally nonessential amino acids\" (NEAA) to support maximum production performance. Therefore, over the past 50\\u2009years, much emphasis has been placed on dietary requirements of nutritionally essential amino acids as building blocks for tissue proteins. However, a large body of literature shows that NEAA, particularly glutamine, glutamate, arginine and proline regulate physiological functions via cell signaling pathways, such as mammalian target of rapamycin, AMP-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-related kinase, Jun kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and NEAA-derived gaseous molecules (e.g., nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide). Available evidence shows that under current feeding programs, only 70% and 55% of dietary amino acids are deposited as tissue proteins in 14-day-old sow-reared piglets and in 30-day-old pigs weaned at 21\\u2009days of age, respectively. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the roles and dietary requirements of NEAA in swine nutrition. This review highlights the basic biochemistry and physiology of absorption and utilization of amino acids in young pigs to enhance the efficacy of utilization of dietary protein and to minimize excretion of nitrogenous wastes from the body.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundObjectives were to examine the effects of selenium (Se) supply and maternal nutritional plane during gestation on mammary gland growth, cellular proliferation, and vascularity at parturition and d 20 of lactation. Rambouillet primiparous ewes (n\\u2009=\\u200984) were allocated to treatments in a 2 x 3 factorial. Factors were dietary Se (adequate Se [ASe, 11.5\\xa0μg/kg BW] or high Se [HSe, 77.0\\xa0μg/kg BW]) and nutritional plane (60% [RES], 100% [CON], or 140% [EXC]). At parturition, lambs were removed and 42 ewes (7/treatment) were necropsied. Remaining ewes were fed a common diet meeting requirements for lactation and mechanically milked twice daily until necropsy on d 20. At both necropsy periods, mammary glands were dissected and tissues harvested. Samples were analyzed for RNA, DNA, and protein content, cell proliferation, and vascularity. Where interactions were present (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05), least squares means from the highest-order interaction are presented.ResultsFinal body weight of ewes was least (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.002) in RES, intermediate for CON, and greatest for EXC, regardless of stage of the ewe at necropsy (parturition or d 20 of lactation). In ewes necropsied at parturition, mammary glands were heavier (P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) in EXC compared to RES, with CON intermediate. Concentration of RNA (mg/g) was decreased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.01) in EXC compared to CON at parturition. There was a tendency (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07) for a Se by nutrition interaction in percentage of cells proliferating where ASe-EXC ewes had greater (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.02) number of proliferating cells then all other treatments. Mammary vascular area tended (P\\u2009=\\u20090.08) to be affected by a Se by nutrition interaction where ASe-CON had less (P\\u2009=\\u20090.007) vascular area than HSe-CON ewes. In ewes necropsied at d 20 of lactation, the number of alveoli per area was decreased (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05) in RES compared to CON and EXC-fed ewes.ConclusionsResults of this study indicate that proper maternal nutritional plane during gestation is important for mammary gland development, even out to d 20 of lactation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a major foodborne pathogen worldwide. S. Typhimurium encodes type III secretion systems via Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI), producing the major effector proteins of virulence. Previously, we identified two genes of Salmonella pyruvate metabolism that were up-regulated during chicken cell infection: pyruvate formate lyase I (pflB) and bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE). We were therefore interested in examining the role these genes may play in the transmission of Salmonella to humans.MethodsMutant strains of Salmonella with single gene deletions for pflB and adhE were created. Invasion and growth in human HCT-8 intestinal epithelial cells and THP-1 macrophages was examined. Quantitative PCR was performed on 19 SPI-1 genes.ResultsIn HCT-8 cells, both mutant strains had significantly higher intracellular counts than the wild-type from 4 to 48\\xa0h post-infection. Various SPI-1 genes in the mutants were up-regulated over the wild-type as early as 1\\xa0h and lasting until 24\\xa0h post-infection. In THP-1 cells, no significant difference in internal Salmonella counts was observed; however, SPI-1 genes were largely down-regulated in the mutants during the time-course of infection. We also found five SPI-1 genes - hilA, hilC hilD, sicP and rtsA - which were up-regulated in at least one of the mutant strains in log-phase broth cultures alone. We have therefore identified a set of SPI-1 virulence genes whose regulation is effected by the central metabolism of Salmonella.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThe development of new/different management and feeding strategies to stimulate gut development and health in newly-weaned pigs, in order to improve growth performance while minimizing the use of antimicrobial compounds such as antibiotic growth promotants (AGP) and heavy mineral compounds, is essential for the long-term sustainability of the pig industry. Factors including the sub-optimal intake of nutrients and energy, inappropriate microbiota biomass and (or) balance, immature and compromised immune function, and psychosomatic factors caused by weaning can compromise both the efficiency of digestion and absorption and intestinal barrier function through mucosal damage and alteration of tight junction integrity. As a consequence, pigs at weaning are highly susceptible to pathogenic enteric conditions such as post-weaning diarrhea that may be caused by serotypes of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Many dietary components, e.g., protein, fiber, feed additives and minerals, are known to influence microbial growth in the gastrointestinal tract that in turn can impact upon pig growth and health, although the relationships between these are sometimes not necessarily apparent or obvious. In a world climate of increased scrutiny over the use of antibiotics per se in pig production, certain feed additives are seen as alternatives/replacements to antibiotics, and have evolved in some cases to have important roles in everyday commercial pig nutrition. Nevertheless and in general, there remains inconsistency and variability in the efficacy of some feed additives and in cases of severe disease outbreaks, for example, therapeutic antibiotics and/or heavy minerals such as zinc oxide (ZnO) are generally relied upon. If feed ingredients and (or) feed additives are to be used with greater regularity and reliability, then it is necessary to better understand the mechanisms whereby antibiotics and minerals such as ZnO influence animal physiology, in conjunction with the use of appropriate challenge models and in vitro and in vivo techniques.',\n",

Thirty pregnant Landrace sows were assigned to one of three treatments from d 108 of gestation until weaning (26–29 d) and were fed diets containing different ratios of n-6:n-3 PUFA including 3:1, 9:1 and 13:1. The effects on sow and litter production traits were examined together with an assessment of sow body condition. No differences were detected among the treatments for the daily feed intake of sows or changes in sow weight and back-fat levels during lactation (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Litter size at d 14 and d 21 were tended to increase in 3:1 treatment compared with 9:1 and 13:1 treatments (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10). Litter weight gain (1.77\\u2009kg/d) from d 0 to d 14 was tended to increase in 9:1 groups compared with the other two treatments (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10). A significant difference was observed for the content of α -linolenic acid, total n-3 PUFA, and the ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFA in the colostrum, milk, and piglets plasma (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The effects of different ratios of n-6:n-3 PUFA in sow diets on colostrum, milk, and piglet plasma immunoglobulin concentrations are studied. No difference was observed among treatments in the concentrations of IgM, and IgA in colostrum (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). A great significant difference for IgG concentration was observed among 3 group in colostrum. A great significant difference for IgA, and IgM (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) concentrations in piglet plasma at d14 and a significant difference for IgG(P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) was observed at d14. Furthermore, at d 21 of lactation, piglet plasma IgG and IgA concentration were greater in 3:1 compared with 13:1 group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).In summary, the current study demonstrated that altering the ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFA in lactating sow diet had an effect on the immune component including immunoglobulin and cytokines, and it tended to increase the litter average daily gain and improve the immune status of piglets when dietary ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFA was 9:1.',\n",

The birth order and weight of 745 piglets (from 75 litters) were recorded during a one-week period of farrowing. Only pigs weighing greater than 0.68 kg birth weight were chosen for the trial. Sow colostrum was collected during parturition, and piglets were bled between 48 and 72 hours post-birth. Piglet serum IgG and colostral IgG concentrations were determined by radial immunodiffusion.ResultsSow parity had a significant (P < 0.001) effect on sow colostral IgG concentration, being 5% higher in multiparous females. Sow colostral IgG concentration explained 6% and piglet birth order accounted for another 4% of the variation observed in piglet serum IgG concentration (P < 0.05); however, birth weight had no detectable effect. Piglet serum IgG concentration had both a linear (P < 0.05) and quadratic effect (P < 0.05) on % survival. Piglets with 1,000 mg/dl serum IgG or less (n=24) had a 67% survival; whereas, piglets with IgG concentrations between 2250 to 2500 mg/dl (n=247) had a 91% survival. Birth order had no detectable effect on survival, but birth weight had a positive linear effect (P < 0.05). Piglets weighing 0.9 kg (n = 107) at birth had a 68% survival rate, and those weighing 1.6 kg (n = 158) had an 89% survival.ConclusionWe found that the combination of sow colostrum IgG concentration and birth order can account for 10% of the variation of piglet serum IgG concentration and that piglets with less than 1,000 mg/dl IgG serum concentration and weight of 0.9 kg at birth had low survival rate when compared to their larger siblings. The effective management of colostrum uptake in neonatal piglets in the first 24 hrs post-birth may potentially improve survival from birth to weaning.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractAscites syndrome is still a problem for chicken industry in various parts of the world. Despite the intensive investigations of this syndrome for many years, its pathogenesis remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the difference in hepatic proteomics between ascites and healthy broilers by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Changes of biochemical parameters of liver and blood were also determined. The results indicated that red blood cell counts (RBC), hematocrit (HCT) and haemoglobin (HGB) of ascites broilers were significantly greater than healthy broilers. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) level of ascites broilers was significantly increased, and the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) was significantly decreased. Hepatic lactic acid (LD) level of ascitic broilers were significantly lower than healthy ones. Serum glucose and cholesterol level of ascites broilers were significantly increased, and serum globulin level was significantly decreased in ascites broilers. There was no significant difference in triglyceride (TG) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. The activity of liver hexokinase (HK) and succinodehydrogenase (SDH) in ascites broilers was significantly decreased, and there was no significant difference in the activity of liver pyruvate kinase (PK) and Na+-K+-ATPase. The hepatic proteomics analysis showed that 18 proteins expression difference were identified between ascites and healthy broilers. These proteins were mainly involved in: 1) cytoskeleton; 2) glucose, lipids and amino acid metabolism; 3) cell secretion; 4) cell apoptosis; 5) signal transduction; 6) immune and inflammatory response; and 7) cellular redox homeostasis. Mitochondrial isoform phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (M-PEPCK) mainly participates in gluconeogenesis of chicken liver. In conclusion, liver oxidative damage was significantly aggravated, but antioxidant capacity was decreased in cold-induced ascites broilers. Serum glucose level was significantly increased, with liver M-PEPCK expression higher in ascites broilers, which implied that some potential regulatory reagents may reduce ascites susceptibility and mortality under cold temperature by increasing liver gluconeogenesis level.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIn complex feed structures, there exist main chemical functional groups which are associated with nutrient utilization and availability and functionality. Each functional group has unique molecular structure therefore produce unique molecular vibration spectral profile. Feed processing has been used to improve nutrient utilization for many years. However, to date, there was little study on processing-induced changes of feed intrinsic structure and functional groups on a molecular basis within intact tissue. This is because limited research technique is available to study inherent structure on a molecular basis. Recently bioanalytical techniques: such as Synchrotron Infrared Microspectroscopy as well as Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform molecular spectroscopy have been developed. These techniques enable to detect molecular structure change within intact tissues. These techniques can prevent destruction or alteration of the intrinsic protein structures during processing for analysis. However, these techniques have not been used in animal feed and nutrition research. The objective of this review was show that with the advanced technique, sensitivity and responses of functional groups to feed processing on a molecular basis could be detected in my research team. These functional groups are highly associated with nutrient utilization in animals.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundFibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) inhibits growth-plate chondrocyte proliferation and limits bone elongation. Gain-of-function FGFR3 mutations cause dwarfism, reduced telomerase activity and shorter telomeres in growth plate chondroyctes suggesting that FGFR3 reduces proliferative capacity, inhibits telomerase, and enhances senescence. Thyroid hormone (T3) plays a role in cellular maturation of growth plate chondrocytes and a known target of T3 is FGFR3. The present study addressed whether reduced FGFR3 expression enhanced telomerase activity, mRNA expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and RNA component of telomerase (TR), and chondrocyte proliferation, and whether the stimulation of FGFR3 by T3 evoked the opposite response.ResultsSheep growth-plate proliferative zone chondrocytes were cultured and transfected with siRNA to reduce FGFR3 expression; FGFR3 siRNA reduced chondrocyte FGFR3 mRNA and protein resulting in greater proliferation and increased TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Chondrocytes treated with T3 significantly enhanced FGFR3 mRNA and protein expression and reduced telomerase activity (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05); TERT and TR were not significantly reduced. The action of T3 at the growth plate may be partially mediated through the FGFR3 pathway.ConclusionsThe results suggest that FGFR3 inhibits chondrocyte proliferation by down-regulating TERT expression and reducing telomerase activity indicating an important role for telomerase in sustaining chondrocyte proliferative capacity during bone elongation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundSheep is important in the socio-economic lives of people around the world. It is estimated that more than half of our once common livestock breeds are now endangered. Since genetic characterization of Nigerian sheep is still lacking, we analyzed ten morphological traits on 402 animals and 15 microsatellite DNA markers in 384 animals of the 4 Nigerian sheep breeds to better understand genetic diversity for breeding management and germplasm conservation.ResultsMorphological traits of Uda and Balami were significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) higher than Yankasa, which were both higher than West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed tail length, rump height, chest girth, ear length and chest depth as the most discriminating variables for classification. Mahalanobis distances show the least differentiation between Uda and Balami and the largest between WAD and Balami sheep. While 93.3% of WAD sheep were correctly assigned to their source genetic group, 63.9% of Yankasa, 61.2% of Balami and 45.2% of Uda were classified correctly by nearest neighbour discriminant analysis. The overall high Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) of all microsatellite markers ranged from 0.751 to 0.927 supporting their use in genetic characterization. Expected heterozygosity was high for all loci (0.783 to 0.93). Mean heterozygote deficiency across all populations (0.171 to 0.534) possibly indicate significant inbreeding (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Mean values for FST, FIT and FIS statistics across all loci were 0.088, 0.394 and 0.336 respectively. Yankasa and Balami are the most closely related breeds (DA\\u2009=\\u20090.184) while WAD and Balami are the farthest apart breeds (DA\\u2009=\\u20090.665), which is coincident with distance based on morphological analysis and population structure assessed by STRUCTURE.ConclusionsThese results suggest that within-breed genetic variation in Nigerian sheep is higher than between-breeds and may be a valuable tool for genetic improvement and conservation. The higher genetic variability in Yankasa suggests the presence of unique ancestral alleles reflecting the presence of certain functional genes which may result in better adaptability in more agro-ecological zones of Nigeria. These genetic characteristics are potentially useful in planning improvement and conservation strategies in Nigerian indigenous sheep.',\n",

Ewes were assigned randomly to receive 37.5 IU of porcine follicle stimulating hormone (FSH-P) daily for the 3 days preceding implant removal (Day 0). Synchronization of estrus was carried out using a 1.5 mg norgestomet (Crestar) ear implant for 12 days. Ewes in estrus were mated two to three times with rams of proven fertility. At the time of first mating each ewe was administered 1000 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to induce ovulation. Surgical embryo recovery was performed on Days 4 and 6 after onset of estrus (Day 0) and recovered embryos were subjected to comparative metabolism studies with in vitro derived embryos at the same stage of development. The number of corpora lutea (CL), unovulated follicles and overall ovarian activity were recorded for each ewe during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. While the pattern of oxidation was similar among in vitro and in vivo derived embryos, a low pyruvate to lactate ratio was the preferred substrate of embryos derived in vitro. A high level of production of CO2 and lactate resulted from a stress response to the suboptimal culture environment. The first marked increase in the metabolism of glucose by ovine embryos was detected in compact morula stage, but there was no significant increase in the oxidation of glucose after the morula stage. Two different concentrations of glucose were compared, but this did not affect metabolism. However, the rate of incorporation and metabolism of glucose tended to be higher at the 0.56 mmol/L glucose dosage.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to identify the most stable housekeeping genes in porcine articular cartilage subjected to a mechanical injury from a panel of 10 candidate genes.ResultsTen candidate housekeeping genes were evaluated in three different treatment groups of mechanically impacted porcine articular cartilage. The genes evaluated were: beta actin, beta-2-microglobulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hydroxymethylbilane synthase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase, peptidylprolyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A), ribosomal protein L4, succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit A, TATA box binding protein, and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein—zeta polypeptide. The stability of the genes was measured using geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder software. The four most stable genes measured via geNorm were (most to least stable) succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein, subunit A, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta actin; the four most stable genes measured via BestKeeper were glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, beta actin, succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein, subunit A; and the four most stable genes measured via NormFinder were peptidylprolyl isomerase A, succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein, subunit A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta actin.ConclusionsBestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder all generated similar results for the most stable genes in porcine articular cartilage. The use of these appropriate reference genes will facilitate accurate gene expression studies of porcine articular cartilage and suggest appropriate housekeeping genes for articular cartilage studies in other species.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractOver the past years, infectious disease has caused enormous economic loss in pig industry. Among the pathogens, gram negative bacteria not only cause inflammation, but also cause different diseases and make the pigs more susceptible to virus infection. Vaccination, medication and elimination of sick pigs are major strategies of controlling disease. Genetic methods, such as selection of disease resistance in the pig, have not been widely used. Recently, the completion of the porcine whole genome sequencing has provided powerful tools to identify the genome regions that harboring genes controlling disease or immunity. Immunogenomics, which combines DNA variations, transcriptome, immune response, and QTL mapping data to illustrate the interactions between pathogen and host immune system, will be an effective genomics tool for identification of disease resistance genes in pigs. These genes will be potential targets for disease resistance in breeding programs. This paper reviewed the progress of disease resistance study in the pig focusing on Gram-negative bacilli. Major porcine Gram-negative bacilli and diseases, suggested candidate genes/pathways against porcine Gram-negative bacilli, and distributions of QTLs for immune capacity on pig chromosomes were summarized. Some tools for immunogenomics research were described. We conclude that integration of sequencing, whole genome associations, functional genomics studies, and immune response information is necessary to illustrate molecular mechanisms and key genes in disease resistance.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundMuscle growth depends on the fusion of proliferate satellite cells to existing myofibers. We reported previously that 0–14 day intermittent feeding led to persistent retardation in myofiber hypertrophy. However, how satellite cells respond to such nutritional insult has not been adequately elucidated.ResultsOne-day-old broiler chicks were allocated to control (Con, ad libitum feeding), intermittent feeding (IF, feed provided on alternate days) and re-feeding (RF, 2 days ad libitum feeding after 12 days of intermittent feeding) groups. Chickens were killed on Day 15 and satellite cells were isolated. When cultured, satellite cells from the IF group demonstrated significant retardation in proliferation and differentiation potential, while RF partly restored the proliferation rate and differentiation potential of the satellite cells. Significant up-regulation of insulin like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) (P< 0.05) and thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) (P< 0.05), and down-regulation of growth hormone receptor (GHR) (P< 0.01) and IGF-I (P< 0.01) mRNA expression was observed in freshly isolated IF satellite cells when compared with Con cells. In RF cells, the mRNA expression of IGF-I was higher (P< 0.05) and of TRα was lower (P< 0.01) than in IF cells, suggesting that RF restored the mRNA expression of TRα and IGF-I, but not of GHR and IGF-IR. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio tended to increase in the IF group, which was reversed in the RF group (P< 0.05), indicating that RF reduced the pro-apoptotic influence of IF. Moreover, no significant effect of T3 was detected on cell survival in IF cells compared with Con (P<0.001) or RF (P< 0.05) cells.ConclusionsThese data suggest that early-age feed restriction inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells, induces changes in mRNA expression of the GH/IGF-I and thyroid hormone receptors in satellite cells, as well as blunted sensitivity of satellite cells to T3, and that RF partially reverses these effects. Thus, a moderate nutritional strategy for feed restriction should be chosen in early chick rearing systems.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundα-galactosidase has been widely used in animal husbandry to reduce anti-nutritional factors (such as α-galactoside) in feed. Intestine-specific and substrate inducible expression of α-galactosidase would be highly beneficial for transgenic animal production.MethodsTo achieve the intestine-specific and substrate inducible expression of α-galactosidase, we first identified intestine-specific promoters by comparing the transcriptional activity and tissue specificity of four intestine-specific promoters from human intestinal fatty acid binding protein, rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein, human mucin-2 and human lysozyme. We made two chimeric constructs combining the promoter and enhancer of human mucin-2, rat intestinal trefoil factor and human sucrase-isomaltase. Then a modified lac operon system was constructed to investigate the induction of α-galactosidase expression and enzyme activity by isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and an α-galactosidase substrate, α-lactose.We declared that the research carried out on human (Zhai Yafeng) was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, and experimental research on animals also followed internationally recognized guidelines.ResultsThe activity of the human mucin-2 promoter was about 2 to 3 times higher than that of other intestine-specific promoters. In the lac operon system, the repressor significantly decreased (P < 0.05) luciferase activity by approximately 6.5-fold and reduced the percentage of cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) by approximately 2-fold. In addition, the expression level of α-galactosidase mRNA was decreased by 6-fold and α-galactosidase activity was reduced by 8-fold. In line with our expectations, IPTG and α-lactose supplementation reversed (P < 0.05) the inhibition and produced a 5-fold increase of luciferase activity, an 11-fold enhancement in the percentage of cells with GFP expression and an increase in α-galactosidase mRNA abundance (by about 5-fold) and α-galactosidase activity (by about 7-fold).ConclusionsWe have successfully constructed a high specificity inducible lac operon system in an intestine-derived cell line, which could be of great value for gene therapy applications and transgenic animal production.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundSoybean isoflavones are structurally similar to mammalian estrogens and therefore may act as estrogen agonists or antagonists. However, it has not been determined if they have any negative effects on reproductive parameters in male livestock. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soybean isoflavones on male reproduction using Chinese mini-pig boars as a model. Fifty Xiang boars were randomly divided into five groups and fed diets containing 0, 125, 250, or 500 ppm soybean isoflavones or 0.5 ppm diethylstilbestrol for 60 days.ResultsDietary supplementation with 250 ppm of soy isoflavones markedly increased the testis index (P < 0.05), fructose content (P < 0.05), and α-glycosidase content in testicular tissue (P < 0.01), as well as increased the number of viable germ cells (P < 0.01) and the level of Bcl-2 protein (P < 0.01). However, 500 ppm of soybean isoflavones significantly reduced both testis and epididymis indexes (P < 0.05) and lactate dehydrogenase levels (P < 0.01), as well as reduced serum LH and testosterone levels (P < 0.05). High levels of soybean isoflavones also increased malondialdehyde levels (P < 0.05), as well as increased the numbers of early and late apoptotic germ cells (P < 0.01) and the level of Bax proteins (P < 0.05) in the testis.ConclusionsThe results of this study indicate that consumption of soy isoflavones at dietary levels up to 250 ppm did not adversely affect reproductive parameters in Chinese mini-pig boars whereas higher levels of soy isoflavones may adversely affect male reproduction.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractIn the present study, the effect of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) on long-chain fatty acid oxidation by hepatocytes isolated from suckled neonatal pig liver (a low ketogenic and lipogenic tissue) was tested. Incubation of hepatocytes with AICAR (0.5 mM) in the presence of 1 mM of carnitine and 10 mM of glucose for 1 hour at 37°C had no significant effect on total [1-14C]-palmitate (0.5 mM) oxidation (14CO2 and 14C-Acid soluble products (ASP)). Consistent with the fatty acid oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity and inhibition of its activity by malonyl-CoA (10 μM) assayed in cell homogenate also remained constant. However, addition of AICAR to the hepatocytes decreased 14CO2 production by 18% compared to control (p < 0.06). The reduction of labeled carboxylic carbon accumulated in CO2 caused a significant difference in distribution of oxidative products between 14CO2 and 14C-ASP (p < 0.03) compared with the control. It was also noticed that acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was increased by AICAR (p < 0.03), indicating that ACC might drive acetyl-CoA toward fatty acid synthesis pathway and induce an increase in distribution of fatty acid carbon to 14C-ASP. Addition of insulin to hepatocyte incubations with AICAR did not change the oxidative product distribution between CO2 and ASP, but further promoted ACC activity. The increased ACC activity was 70% higher than in the control group when citrate was absent in the reaction medium and was 30% higher when citrate was present in the medium. Our results suggest that AICAR may affect the distribution of metabolic products from fatty acid oxidation by changing ACC activity in hepatocyte isolated from suckled neonatal piglets; however, the basis for the increase in ACC activity elicited by AICAR is not apparent.',\n",

When released from a cell, DTA is nontoxic and cannot enter other cells independently without the help of diphtheria toxin B.

This recombinant vector was then transfected into 293T cells to observe the effect of DTA protein expression on enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) protein expression and the proliferation of 293T cells. After 48 h, high levels of EGFP expression were seen in control pEGFP-N1-transfected cells, whereas very low levels were seen in cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-DTA. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the expression of the DTA gene in cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-DTA. Further, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay revealed a significant difference in cell proliferation between the control group and the pEGFP-N1-DTA-transfected group.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundThe number and diversity of uncultured ruminal bacterial and archaeal species revealed by 16S rRNA gene (rrs) sequences greatly exceeds that of cultured bacteria and archaea. However, the significance of uncultured microbes remains undetermined. The objective of this study was to assess the numeric importance of select uncultured bacteria and cultured bacteria and the impact of diets and microenvironments within cow rumen in a comparative manner.ResultsLiquid and adherent fractions were obtained from the rumen of Jersey cattle fed hay alone and Holstein cattle fed hay plus grain. The populations of cultured and uncultured bacteria present in each fraction were quantified using specific real-time PCR assays. The population of total bacteria was similar between fractions or diets, while total archaea was numerically higher in the hay-fed Jersey cattle than in the hay-grain-fed Holstein cattle. The population of the genus Prevotella was about one log smaller than that of total bacteria. The populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the genus Butyrivibrio, and R. albus was at least one log smaller than that of genus Prevotella. Four of the six uncultured bacteria quantified were as abundant as F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and the genus Butyrivibrio. In addition, the populations of several uncultured bacteria were significantly higher in the adherent fractions than in the liquid fractions. These uncultured bacteria may be associated with fiber degradation.ConclusionsSome uncultured bacteria are as abundant as those of major cultured bacteria in the rumen. Uncultured bacteria may have important contribution to ruminal fermentation. Population dynamic studies of uncultured bacteria in a comparative manner can help reveal their ecological features and importance to rumen functions.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractFeed intake control is vital to ensuring optimal nutrition and achieving full potential for growth and development in poultry. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of L-leucine, L-glutamate, L-tryptophan and L-arginine on feed intake and the mRNA expression levels of hypothalamic Neuropeptide involved in feed intake regulation in broiler chicks. Leucine, glutamate, tryptophan or arginine was intra-cerebroventricularly (ICV) administrated to 4d-old broiler chicks respectively and the feed intake were recorded at various time points. Quantitative PCR was performed to determine the hypothalamic mRNA expression levels of Neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti related protein (AgRP), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). Our results showed that ICV administration of L-leucine (0.15 or 1.5\\u2009\\u2009μmol) significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) increased feed intake up to 2\\u2009h post-administration period and elevated both hypothalamic NPY and AgRP mRNA expression levels. In contrast, ICV administration of L-glutamate (1.6\\u2009\\u2009μmol) significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) decreased feed intake 0.25, 0.5 and 2\\u2009h post-injection, and increased hypothalamic CRF and MC4R mRNA expression levels. Meanwhile, both L-tryptophan (10 or 100\\u2009\\u2009μg) and L-arginine (20 or 200\\u2009\\u2009μg) had no significant effect on feed intake. These findings suggested that L-leucine and L-glutamate could act within the hypothalamus to influence food intake, and that both orexigenic and anorexigenic Neuropeptide genes might contribute directly to these effects.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractDomestic animals are invaluable resources for study of the molecular architecture of complex traits. Although the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for economically important traits in domestic animals has achieved remarkable results in recent decades, not all of the genetic variation in the complex traits has been captured because of the low density of markers used in QTL mapping studies. The genome wide association study (GWAS), which utilizes high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), provides a new way to tackle this issue. Encouraging achievements in dissection of the genetic mechanisms of complex diseases in humans have resulted from the use of GWAS. At present, GWAS has been applied to the field of domestic animal breeding and genetics, and some advances have been made. Many genes or markers that affect economic traits of interest in domestic animals have been identified. In this review, advances in the use of GWAS in domestic animals are described.',\n",

Pastures contained 1 of the following 3 seeding mixtures (2 pastures/mixture): 1) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam., WRG), 2) wheat and ryegrass plus red clover (Trifolium pretense L., WRR), or 3) wheat and ryegrass plus white (Trifolium repens L.) and crimson clovers (Trifolium incarnatum L., WRW). All groups had ad libitum access to grass hay (12% crude protein; 58% total digestible nutrients). The second week in December, cow estrous cycles were synchronized and artificially inseminated. In late December, a bull was placed with each group for 60-d. Data were analyzed with an analysis of variance using a mixed model containing treatment as the fixed effect and year as the random effect. Body weight and condition scores did not differ (P ≥ 0.27) among cows between February and June.

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundComplex vertebral malformation (CVM) and bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD) are two autosomal recessive lethal genetic defects frequently occurring in Holstein cattle, identifiable by single nucleotide polymorphisms. The objective of this study is to develop a rapid and reliable genotyping assay to screen the active Holstein sires and determine the carrier frequency of CVM and BLAD in Chinese dairy cattle population.ResultsWe developed real-time PCR-based assays for discrimination of wild-type and defective alleles, so that carriers can be detected. Only one step was required after the DNA extraction from the sample and time consumption was about 2 hours. A total of 587 Chinese Holstein bulls were assayed, and fifty-six CVM-carriers and eight BLAD-carriers were identified, corresponding to heterozygote carrier frequencies of 9.54% and 1.36%, respectively. The pedigree analysis showed that most of the carriers could be traced back to the common ancestry, Osborndale Ivanhoe for BLAD and Pennstate Ivanhoe Star for CVM.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that real-time PCR is a simple, rapid and reliable assay for BLAD and CVM defective allele detection. The high frequency of the CVM allele suggests that implementing a routine testing system is necessary to gradually eradicate the deleterious gene from the Chinese Holstein population.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractThere is a dialogue between the developing conceptus (embryo-fetus and associated placental membranes) and maternal uterus which must be established during the peri-implantation period for pregnancy recognition signaling, implantation, regulation of gene expression by uterine epithelial and stromal cells, placentation and exchange of nutrients and gases. The uterus provide a microenvironment in which molecules secreted by uterine epithelia or transported into the uterine lumen represent histotroph required for growth and development of the conceptus and receptivity of the uterus to implantation. Pregnancy recognition signaling mechanisms sustain the functional lifespan of the corpora lutea (CL) which produce progesterone, the hormone of pregnancy essential for uterine functions that support implantation and placentation required for a successful outcome of pregnancy. It is within the peri-implantation period that most embryonic deaths occur due to deficiencies attributed to uterine functions or failure of the conceptus to develop appropriately, signal pregnancy recognition and/or undergo implantation and placentation. With proper placentation, the fetal fluids and fetal membranes each have unique functions to ensure hematotrophic and histotrophic nutrition in support of growth and development of the fetus. The endocrine status of the pregnant female and her nutritional status are critical for successful establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. This review addresses the complexity of key mechanisms that are characteristic of successful reproduction in sheep and pigs and gaps in knowledge that must be the subject of research in order to enhance fertility and reproductive health of livestock species.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBarley grain (Hordeum vulgare L.) is characterized by a thick fibrous coat, a high level of ß-glucans and simply-arranged starch granules. World production of barley is about 30 % of that of corn. In comparison with corn, barley has more protein, methionine, lysine, cysteine and tryptophan. For ruminants, barley is the third most readily degradable cereal behind oats and wheat. Due to its more rapid starch fermentation rate compared with corn, barley also provides a more synchronous release of energy and nitrogen, thereby improving microbial nutrient assimilation. As a result, feeding barley can reduce the need for feeding protected protein sources. However, this benefit is only realized if rumen acidity is maintained within an optimal range (e.g., > 5.8 to 6.0); below this range, microbial maintenance requirements and wastage increase. With a low pH, microbial endotoxines cause pro-inflammatory responses that can weaken immunity and shorten animal longevity. Thus, mismanagement in barley processing and feeding may make a tragedy from this treasure or pearl of cereal grains. Steam-rolling of barley may improve feed efficiency and post-rumen starch digestion. However, it is doubtful if such processing can improve milk production and feed intake. Due to the need to process barley less extensively than other cereals (as long as the pericarp is broken), consistent and global standards for feeding and processing barley could be feasibly established. In high-starch diets, barley feeding reduces the need for capacious small intestinal starch assimilation, subsequently reducing hindgut starch use and fecal nutrient loss. With its nutritional exclusivities underlined, barley use will be a factual art that can either matchlessly profit or harm rumen microbes, cattle production, farm economics and the environment.',\n",

Male C57BL/6\\u2009J mice, fed a 60% Kcal fat diet for 8\\u2009weeks prior to the start of the study, were vaccinated via the intraperitoneal route with two formulations (JH17 & JH18) of chimeric-somatostatin vaccines at 1 and 22\\u2009days of the study. Control mice were injected with PBS. All mice continued to be feed the 60% Kcal fat diet for the 6\\u2009week study. Body weights were measured two times a week and food intake was measured weekly. At week 6, mice were euthanized and a terminal bleed was made and antibody levels to somatostatin and levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were determined. Vaccination with both vaccine formulations induced a statistically significant body weight change over the study period, as compared with PBS controls. Percentage of baseline body weight was also significantly affected by vaccination during the study period. Vaccinates finished the study at 104% and 107% of baseline weight, JH17 & JH18 respectively, while untreated controls reached 115% of baseline weight. Food intake per mouse was similar in all mouse groups during the entire study. Control mice did not demonstrate any antibody titers to somatostatin, while all vaccinated mice had measurable antibody responses (> 1:500,000 titer). IGF-1 levels were not statistically significant among the groups, but were elevated in the JH18 vaccinates (mean 440.4\\u2009ng/mL) when compared with PBS controls (mean 365.6\\u2009ng/mL). Vaccination with either JH17 or JH18 chimeric –somatostatin vaccines produced a statistically significant weight loss as compared with PBS controls (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), even though the DIO mice with continually fed a 60% Kcal fat diet. The weight loss/lower weight gain observations were even more significant, as all mice consumed similar amounts of food for the entire study. The presence of high levels of anti-somatostatin antibodies at 6\\u2009weeks was correlative with the weight observations and confirmed the success of vaccination.',\n",

Four livestock species—cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses—express a full range of Ig heavy chains (IgHs), including μ, δ, γ, ϵ, and α. Two poultry species (chickens and ducks) express three IgH isotypes, μ, υ, and α, but not δ. The κ and λ light chains are both utilized in the four livestock species, but only the λ chain is expressed in poultry. V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation (SHM), and gene conversion (GC) are three distinct mechanisms by which immunoglobulin variable region diversity is generated. Different domestic animals may use distinct means to diversify rearranged variable regions of Ig genes.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractBackgroundA leptin-like immunoreactive substance has been found in chicken eggs and has been implicated in serving as a maternal signal to program offspring growth and metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the effects of in ovo leptin administration on hatch weight, serum and hepatic concentrations of metabolites and hormones, as well as on the expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and the predicted microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the affected genes. To this end we injected fertile eggs with either 0.5 μg of recombinant murine leptin or vehicle (PBS) before incubation.ResultsPrenatally leptin-exposed chicks showed lower hatch weight, but higher liver weight relative to the body weight, compared to the control group. In ovo leptin treatment increased the hepatic content and serum concentration of leptin in newly hatched chickens. The hepatic contents of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (Tch) were decreased, whereas the serum levels of TG, Tch and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) were increased. The hepatic mRNA expression of sterol regulator element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), SREBP-2, hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1) was significantly up-regulated, as was the protein content of both SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 in hepatic nuclear extracts of leptin-treated chickens. Moreover, out of 12 miRNAs targeting SREBP-1c and/or HMGCR, five were significantly up-regulated in liver of leptin-treated chicks, including gga-miR-200b and gga-miR-429, which target both SREBP-1c and HMGCR.ConclusionsThese results suggest that leptin in ovo decreases hatch weight, and modifies hepatic leptin secretion and lipid metabolism in newly hatched broiler chickens, possibly via microRNA-mediated gene regulation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractCathelicidins are a major family of antimicrobial peptides present in vertebrate animals with potent microbicidal and immunomodulatory activities. Four cathelicidins, namely fowlicidins 1 to 3 and cathelicidin B1, have been identified in chickens. As a first step to understand their role in early innate host defense of chickens, we examined the tissue and developmental expression patterns of all four cathelicidins. Real-time PCR revealed an abundant expression of four cathelicidins throughout the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts as well as in all primary and secondary immune organs of chickens. Fowlicidins 1 to 3 exhibited a similar tissue expression pattern with the highest expression in the bone marrow and lung, while cathelicidin B1 was synthesized most abundantly in the bursa of Fabricius. Additionally, a tissue-specific regulatory pattern was evident for all four cathelicidins during the first 28 days after hatching. The expression of fowlicidins 1 to 3 showed an age-dependent increase both in the cecal tonsil and lung, whereas all four cathelicidins were peaked in the bursa on day 4 after hatching, with a gradual decline by day 28. An abrupt augmentation in the expression of fowlicidins 1 to 3 was also observed in the cecum on day 28, while the highest expression of cathelicidin B1 was seen in both the lung and cecal tonsil on day 14. Collectively, the presence of cathelicidins in a broad range of tissues and their largely enhanced expression during development are suggestive of their potential important role in early host defense and disease resistance of chickens.',\n",

They are probably involved in immunosuppression of the dam against the feto-maternal placentome.

The exact structure and function of the gene product is unknown due to limitations on obtaining purified pregnancy associated glycoprotein preparations.ResultsOur study describes an in silico derived 3D model for bubaline pregnancy associated glycoprotein 2. Structure-activity features of the protein were characterized, and functional studies predict bubaline pregnancy associated glycoprotein 2 as an inducible, extra-cellular, non-essential, N-glycosylated, aspartic pro-endopeptidase that is involved in down-regulation of complement pathway and immunity during pregnancy. The protein is also predicted to be involved in nutritional processes, and apoptotic processes underlying fetal morphogenesis and re-modeling of feto-maternal tissues.ConclusionThe structural and functional annotation of bu PAG2 shall allow the designing of mutants and inhibitors for dissection of the exact physiological role of the protein.',\n",

Eighty male rats were used in two 21-day feeding trials in which they were fed diets with either high δ13C levels (δ13C\\u2009=\\u2009−13.89‰ and δ15N\\u2009=\\u20092.37‰ in experiment 1 and δ13C\\u2009=\\u2009−19.34‰ and δ15N\\u2009=\\u20094.73‰ in experiment 2) or low δ13C levels (δ13C\\u2009=\\u2009−17.90‰ and δ15N\\u2009=\\u20093.08‰ in experiment 1 and δ13C\\u2009=\\u2009−21.76‰ and δ15N\\u2009=\\u20090.53‰ in experiment 2), meanwhile, the dietary δ15N levels were designed to two ranks. Blood, liver, adipose and muscle tissues were collected on day 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 for determination of 13\\u2009C, 12\\u2009C, 15\\u2009N and 14\\u2009N isotopes. Rat growth rate, antioxidant capacity and metabolic parameters were also assessed. The results indicate that adipose tissue tend to deplete 13\\u2009C before the stable isotopic ratios achieved final equilibrium. Therefore, feeds with different isotopic signatures had different incorporation rates into tissues. Low dietary 13\\u2009C levels decreased tissue δ13C values whereas high dietary 13\\u2009C levels did not alter tissue δ13C values during the 21-d experiment. Blood δ15N values were a reliable parameter in assessing the relative contribution of dietary nitrogen to tissues. This study revealed a relationship between dietary isotopic signatures and their incorporation rates into rat tissues. However, more studies are needed to illustrate the mechanism through which dietary isotopic ratios influence the extent of isotopic incorporation into the tissues.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractA total of 335 lactating sows (Landrace × Large White) were used in two experiments to determine the optimum ratio of standardized ileal digestible lysine (SID-Lys) to metabolizable energy (ME) for mixed parity sows during lactation. In Exp. 1, 185 sows (weighing an average of 256.2 ± 6.5 kg and having an average parity of 3.4 ± 0.3) were allocated to one of six experimental diets in a completely randomized block design within parity groups (1, 2, and 3+). The experimental diets were formulated to contain 3.06, 3.16, 3.20, 3.25, 3.30 or 3.40 Mcal/kg of ME and each diet was fed to the sows throughout a 28 day lactation. All diets provided a similar SID-lysine level (0.86%). As a result, the diets provided a SID-Lys:ME ratio of 2.81, 2.72, 2.69, 2.65, 2.61 or 2.53 g/Mcal ME. Sow feed intake was significantly (P < 0.01) affected by the energy content of the diet as well as by sow parity. Using regression analysis, feed intake was shown to be maximized at 3.25, 3.21, 3.21 and 3.21 Mcal/kg of ME for parity 1, 2, 3+ sows and the entire cohort of sows respectively (quadratic; P < 0.01). In addition, the result of feed intake can be expressed as 2.65, 2.69, 2.69 and 2.68 g/Mcal based on analysis of SID-Lys:ME ratio. Litter weight gain was affected by dietary treatment for parity 3+ sows and the entire cohort (P < 0.01). Based on regression analysis, litter weight gain was maximized at 3.25 and 3.24 Mcal/kg of ME for parity 3+ (quadratic; P < 0.01) and the entire cohort (quadratic; P < 0.01). Similarly, the result of litter weight gain could be expressed as 2.65 and 2.66 g/Mcal of SID-Lys:ME ratio. Therefore, 3.25 Mcal/kg of ME was selected for Exp. 2 in which 150 sows (weighing 254.6 ± 7.3 kg and having an average parity of 3.4 ± 0.4) were allocated to one of five treatments in a completely randomized block design within parity (1, 2, and 3+). The experimental diets were formulated to contain 2.1, 2.4, 2.7, 3.0 or 3.3 g/Mcal of SID-Lys:ME ratio with all diets providing 3.25 Mcal/kg of ME. The diets were fed to the sows throughout a 28 day lactation. Sow body weight loss was affected by dietary treatment (parity 3+ sows, P = 0.02; entire cohort, P < 0.01) and by sow parity (P < 0.01). Litter weight at weaning and litter weight gain were affected by dietary treatment for parity 1, 2, 3+ sows and the entire cohort (P < 0.01) as well as by sow parity (P < 0.01). Plasma urea nitrogen (P < 0.01), creatinine (P < 0.01) and non-esterifide fatty acids (P = 0.04) were decreased as the SID-Lys:ME ratio of the diet increased. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (P = 0.02), estradiol (P < 0.01) and luteinizing hormone (P = 0.02) were increased as the SID-Lys:ME ratio in diet increased. Based on a broken-line model, the estimated SID-Lys:ME ratio to maximize litter weight gain was estimated to be 3.05 g/Mcal.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"AbstractLittle information is available about the nutritive value of expanded soybean meal, which is produced by expansion of soybeans prior to solvent extraction of the oil. During processing, expanded soybean meal is subjected to additional heat, which might increase the concentration of ruminally undegraded protein. Processing of soybeans with heat during oil extraction could affect lysine availability by increasing ruminally undegraded protein or by impairing intestinal digestion. Our objective was to compare solvent and expanded soybeans with regard to chemical composition and nutritive value for dairy cattle. Samples of expanded soybean meal (n = 14) and solvent-extracted soybean meal (n = 5) were obtained from People's Republic of China to study effects of the expansion process on nutritive value for dairy cattle. Solvent-extracted soybean meal (n = 2) and mechanically extracted (heated) soybean meal (n = 2) from the United States served as references for comparison. Samples were analyzed for crude fat, long-chain fatty acids, crude protein, amino acids, chemically available lysine, in situ ruminal protein degradation, and in vitro intestinal digestibility. No differences were found between solvent-extracted soybean meals from China and expanded soybean meals from China for crude fat, crude protein, amino acids, or chemically available lysine. In situ disappearance of nitrogen, ruminally undegraded protein content, and in vitro intestinal digestion of the ruminally undegraded protein were generally similar between solvent-extracted soybean meals made in China and expanded soybean meals made in China; variation among soybean meals was small. Results indicate that the additional heat from the expansion process was not great enough to affect the nutritive value of soybean meal protein for ruminants. Although expansion may improve the oil extraction process, the impact on the resulting soybean meal is minimal and does not require consideration when formulating ruminant diets.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': \"AbstractOnly in recent years, the draft sequences for several agricultural animals have been assembled. Assembling an individual animal's entire genome sequence or specific region(s) of interest is increasingly important for agricultural researchers to perform genetic comparisons between animals with different performance. We review the current status for several sequenced agricultural species and suggest that next generation sequencing (NGS) technology with decreased sequencing cost and increased speed of sequencing can benefit agricultural researchers. By taking advantage of advanced NGS technologies, genes and chromosomal regions that are more labile to the influence of environmental factors could be pinpointed. A more long term goal would be addressing the question of how animals respond at the molecular and cellular levels to different environmental models (e.g. nutrition). Upon revealing important genes and gene-environment interactions, the rate of genetic improvement can also be accelerated. It is clear that NGS technologies will be able to assist animal scientists to efficiently raise animals and to better prevent infectious diseases so that overall costs of animal production can be decreased.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMastitis or other infectious diseases have been related to reduced fertility in cattle. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are released in response to infection and may have negative effects on embryo development. In the current study the effect of exposure to TNFα on the development of in vitro fertilized bovine embryos was examined. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, was used to determine if blockade of prostaglandin synthesis would alter the effects of TNFα. Ovaries were obtained from a local abattoir and immature COC were isolated from 2-10 mm follicles, in vitro matured and fertilized. After fertilization, groups of presumptive zygotes were randomly placed into either control development medium, medium containing 25 ng/mL TNFα or medium containing 25 ng/mL TNFα plus 1 μg/mL indomethacin. The proportion of blastocysts formed was assessed at day 7 of culture. Fewer embryos exposed to TNFα alone reached the blastocyst stage (17.5 ± 2.4%, P < 0.01) compared with controls (30.5 ± 2.4%) or embryos developed in TNFα plus indomethacin (25.8 ± 2.8%). There was no difference between control embryos and embryos developed in TNFα plus indomethacin. These results indicate that TNFα is inhibitory to the in vitro development of bovine embryos and that this inhibition may be mediated by prostaglandins because it can be blocked by indomethacin.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractMissing genotypes are a common feature of high density SNP datasets obtained using SNP chip technology and this is likely to decrease the accuracy of genomic selection. This problem can be circumvented by imputing the missing genotypes with estimated genotypes. When implementing imputation, the criteria used for SNP data quality control and whether to perform imputation before or after data quality control need to consider. In this paper, we compared six strategies of imputation and quality control using different imputation methods, different quality control criteria and by changing the order of imputation and quality control, against a real dataset of milk production traits in Chinese Holstein cattle. The results demonstrated that, no matter what imputation method and quality control criteria were used, strategies with imputation before quality control performed better than strategies with imputation after quality control in terms of accuracy of genomic selection. The different imputation methods and quality control criteria did not significantly influence the accuracy of genomic selection. We concluded that performing imputation before quality control could increase the accuracy of genomic selection, especially when the rate of missing genotypes is high and the reference population is small.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractRecent studies have demonstrated that differentiated somatic cells from various mammalian species can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by the ectopic expression of four transcription factors that are highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The generation of patient-specific iPS cells directly from somatic cells without using oocytes or embryos holds great promise for curing numerous diseases that are currently unresponsive to traditional clinical approaches. However, some recent studies have argued that various iPS cell lines may still retain certain epigenetic memories that are inherited from the somatic cells. Such observations have raised concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of using iPS cell derivatives for clinical applications. Recently, our study demonstrated full pluripotency of mouse iPS cells by tetraploid complementation, indicating that it is possible to obtain fully reprogrammed iPS cells directly from differentiated somatic cells. Therefore, we propose in this review that further comprehensive studies of both mouse and human iPS cells are required so that additional information will be available for evaluating the quality of human iPS cells.',\n",

Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of miRNAs in the blood circulation. Deregulation of miRNAs in serum or plasma has been associated with many diseases including cancers and cardiovascular diseases, suggesting the possible use of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers. However, the detection of the small amount of miRNAs found in serum or plasma requires a method with high sensitivity and accuracy. Therefore, the current study describes polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for measuring circulating miRNAs. Briefly, the procedure involves four major steps: (1) sample collection and preparation; (2) global miRNAs profiling using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); (3) data normalization and analysis; and (4) selection and validation of miRNA biomarkers. In conclusion, qRT-PCR is a promising method for profiling of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'AbstractGlutamine is the most abundant amino acid in milk, and lactation is associated with increased glutamine utilization both for milk synthesis and as a fuel for the enlarged small intestine. A number of recent studies have indicated that lactation is accompanied by a mild catabolic state in which skeletal muscle proteins are degraded to provide amino acids that are used to synthesize additional glutamine. In this study we tested the hypothesis that supplemental L-glutamine or the commercially available glutamine supplement Aminogut (2.5% by weight mixed into daily feed) provided to gilts from 30 days prior to parturition until 21 days post-parturition would prevent a decrease in skeletal muscle glutamine while increasing the glutamine content of the milk. Muscle glutamine content decreased (P < 0.05) in control animals during lactation but this was prevented by supplementation with either L-glutamine or Aminogut. In this study, neither lactation nor supplementation had any effect on plasma glutamine or glutamate content. Free glutamine, and the total glutamine plus glutamate concentrations in milk from the control and the Aminogut group rose (P < 0.05) during the first 7 days of lactation, with milk concentrations in the L-glutamine supplemented group showing a similar trend (P = 0.053). Milk glutamate remained constant between day 7 and 21 of lactation in the control and L-glutamine supplemented groups, but by day 21 of lactation the free glutamine, glutamate, and glutamine plus glutamate concentrations in milk from Aminogut-treated gilts were higher than those of control gilts. Thus dietary glutamine supplementation can alleviate the fall in intramuscular glutamine content during lactation in gilts, and may alleviate some of the catabolic effects of lactation. Furthermore, the increased milk glutamine content in the supplemented gilts may provide optimum nutrition for piglet development.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"AbstractNeonatal growth is characterized by a high protein synthesis rate that is largely due to an enhanced sensitivity to the postprandial rise in insulin and amino acids, especially leucine. The mechanism of leucine's action in vivo is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of leucine infusion on protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and liver of neonatal pigs. To evaluate the mode of action of leucine, we used rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex-1 (mTORC1). Overnight-fasted 7-day-old piglets were treated with rapamycin for 1 hour and then infused with leucine (400 μmol·kg-1·h-1) for 1 hour. Leucine infusion increased the rate of protein synthesis, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1) phosphorylation in gastrocnemius and masseter muscles (P < 0.05), but not in the liver. The leucine-induced stimulation of protein synthesis and S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were completely blocked by rapamycin, suggesting that leucine action is by an mTORC1-dependent mechanism. Neither leucine nor rapamycin had any effect on the activation of the upstream mTORC1 regulators, AMP-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B, in skeletal muscle or liver. The activation of eIF2α and elongation factor 2 was not affected by leucine or rapamycin, indicating that these two pathways are not limiting steps of leucine-induced protein synthesis. These results suggest that leucine stimulates muscle protein synthesis in neonatal pigs by inducing the activation of mTORC1 and its downstream pathway leading to mRNA translation.\",\n",

       "['Fibres from a variety of sources are a common constituent of pig feeds. They provide a means to utilise locally-produced plant materials which are often a by-product of the food or drink industry. The value of a high fibre diet in terms of producing satiety has long been recognised. However the addition of fibre can reduce feed intake, which is clearly detrimental during stages of the production cycle when nutrient needs are high, for example in growing piglets and during lactation. More recently, fibre has been found to promote novel benefits to pig production systems, particularly given the reduction in antimicrobial use world-wide, concern for the welfare of animals fed a restricted diet and the need to ensure that such systems are more environmentally friendly. For example, inclusion of dietary fibre can alter the gut microbiota in ways that could reduce the need for antibiotics, while controlled addition of certain fibre types may reduce nitrogen losses into the environment and so reduce the environmental cost of pig production. Of particular potential value is the opportunity to use crude fibre concentrates as ‘functional’ feed additives to improve young pig growth and welfare. Perhaps the greatest opportunity for the use of high fibre diets is to improve the reproductive efficiency of pigs. Increased dietary fibre before mating improves oocyte maturation, prenatal survival and litter size; providing a consumer-acceptable means of increasing the amount of saleable meat produced per sow. The mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects remain to be elucidated. However, changes in plasma and follicular fluid concentrations of key hormones and metabolites, as well as effects of the hypothalamic satiety centre on gonadotrophin secretion and epigenetic effects are strong candidates.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundUnderstanding the composition of the microbial community and its functional capacity during weaning is important for pig production as bacteria play important roles in the pig’s health and growth performance. However, limited information is available regarding the composition and function of the gut microbiome of piglets in early-life. Therefore, we performed 16S rRNA gene and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing of DNA from fecal samples from healthy piglets during weaning to measure microbiome shifts, and to identify the potential contribution of the early-life microbiota in shaping piglet health with a focus on microbial stress responses, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism.ResultsThe analysis of 16S rRNA genes and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing revealed significant compositional and functional differences between the fecal microbiome in nursing and weaned piglets. The fecal microbiome of the nursing piglets showed higher relative abundance of bacteria in the genus Bacteroides with abundant gene families related to the utilization of lactose and galactose. Prevotella and Lactobacillus were enriched in weaned piglets with an enrichment for the gene families associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. In addition, an analysis of the functional capacity of the fecal microbiome showed higher abundances of genes associated with heat shock and oxidative stress in the metagenome of weaned piglets compared to nursing piglets.ConclusionsOverall, our data show that microbial shifts and changes in functional capacities of the piglet fecal microbiome resulted in potential reductions in the effects of stress, including dietary changes that occur during weaning. These results provide us with new insights into the piglet gut microbiome that contributes to the growth of the animal.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundMarbling, or intramuscular fat, is an important factor contributing to the palatability of beef. Vitamin A, through its active metabolite, retinoic acid, promotes the formation of new fat cells (adipogenesis). As intramuscular adipogenesis is active during the neonatal stage, we hypothesized that vitamin A administration during the neonatal stage would enhance intramuscular adipogenesis and marbling.MethodsAngus steer calves (n\\u2009=\\u200930), in a completely randomized design, were randomly allotted to three treatment groups at birth, receiving 0, 150,000, or 300,000\\xa0IU of vitamin A at both birth and one month of age. A biopsy of the biceps femoris muscle was collected at two months of age. After weaning at 210 d of age, steers were fed a backgrounding diet in a feedlot until 308 d of age, when they were transitioned to a high concentrate finishing diet and implanted with trenbolone/estradiol/tylosin mixture. Steers were harvested at an average of 438 d of age. All diets were formulated to meet nutrient requirements.ResultsWeaning weight and weight during the backgrounding phase were linearly increased (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05) by vitamin A level, though no difference in body weight was observed at harvest. Intramuscular fat of steers at 308 d of age, measured by ultrasound, quadratically increased (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05) with vitamin A level from 4.0±0.26 % to 4.9±0.26\\xa0%. Similarly, carcass marbling score in the ribeye quadratically increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionAdministration of vitamin A at birth increased weaning weight and enhanced marbling fat development. Thus, vitamin A administration provides a practical method for increasing marbling and early growth of beef cattle.',\n",
       " 'Recent years have witnessed the great advantages of reducing dietary crude protein (CP) with free amino acids (AA) supplementation for sustainable swine industry, including saving protein ingredients, reducing nitrogen excretion, feed costs and the risk of gut disorders without impairing growth performance compared to traditional diets. However, a tendency toward increased fatness is a matter of concern when pigs are fed low-protein (LP) diets. In response, the use of the net energy system and balanced AA for formulation of LP diets has been proposed as a solution. Moreover, the extent to which dietary CP can be reduced is complicated. Meanwhile, the requirements for the first five limiting AA (lysine, threonine, sulfur-containing AA, tryptophan, and valine) that growing-finishing pigs fed LP diets were higher than pigs fed traditional diets, because the need for nitrogen for endogenous synthesis of non-essential AA to support protein synthesis may be increased when dietary CP is lowered. Overall, to address these concerns and give a better understanding of this nutritional strategy, this paper reviews recent advances in the study of LP diets for swine and provides some insights into future research directions.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundImmune stress induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) influences the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. Presence of LPS interacting Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in the hypothalamus may enable the direct action of LPS on the GnRH/LH secretion. So, the aim of the study was to investigate the influence of intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of TLR4 antagonist on GnRH/LH secretion in anestrous ewes during LPS-induced central inflammation. Animals were divided into three groups icv-treated with: Ringer-Locke solution, LPS and TLR4 antagonist followed by LPS.ResultsIt was demonstrated that TLR4 antagonist reduced LPS-dependent suppression of GnRH gene expression in the preoptic area and in the medial basal hypothalamus, and suppression of receptor for GnRH gene expression in the anterior pituitary gland. It was also shown that TLR4 antagonist reduced suppression of LH release caused by icv injection of LPS. Central administration of LPS stimulated TLR4 gene expression in the medial basal hypothalamus.ConclusionsIt was indicated that blockade of TLR4 prevents the inhibitory effect of centrally acting LPS on the GnRH/LH secretion. This suggests that some negative effects of bacterial infection on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activity at the hypothalamic level may be caused by central action of LPS acting through TLR4.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe present study has evaluated the effects of different inclusion levels of a partially defatted black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.; HI) larva meal on the growth performance, blood parameters and gut morphology of broiler chickens. A total of 256\\xa0male broiler chickens (Ross 308) were reared from d 1 to d 35 and assigned to 4 dietary treatments (8 replicates/treatment and 8 birds/replicate). HI larva meal was included at increasing levels (0, 5%, 10% and 15%; HI0, HI5, HI10 and HI15, respectively) in isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets formulated for 3 feeding phases: starter (1–10 d), growing (10–24 d) and finisher (24–35 d). Two birds per pen were slaughtered at d 35 and morphometric investigations and histopathological alterations were performed.ResultsThe live weight (LW) showed linear and quadratic responses to increasing HI larva meal (maximum for HI10 group). Average daily gain (ADG) showed a linear and quadratic responses to HI meal (maximum for HI10 group) during starter and growing periods. A linear decrease was observed for ADG during the finisher period. The daily feed intake (DFI) showed a linear and quadratic effect during the starter period (maximum for HI10 group). Linear and quadratic responses were observed for the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in the growing period and for the whole period of the experiment. The FCR showed a linear response in the finisher period (maximum for HI15). No significant effects were observed for the blood and serum parameters, except for the phosphorus concentration, which showed linear and quadratic responses as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, the latter of which showed a linear response. The HI15 birds showed a lower villus height, a higher crypt depth and a lower villus height-to-crypt depth ratio than the other groups.ConclusionsIncreasing levels of dietary HI meal inclusion in male broiler chickens may improve the LW and DFI during the starter period, but may also negatively affect the FCR and gut morphology, thus suggesting that low levels may be more suitable. However, no significant effects on the haematochemical parameters or histological findings were observed in relation to HI meal utilization.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundCompared with oral antibiotics (primarily disrupt foregut microbiota), the present study used antibiotics with ileum terminal infusion to disrupt the hindgut microbiota, and investigated the changes in specific bacterial composition and immune indexes in the jejunum and colon, and serum of growing pigs. Twelve barrows (45\\xa0d of age, 12.08\\u2009±\\u20090.28\\xa0kg) fitted with a T-cannula at the terminal ileum, were randomly assigned to two groups and infused either saline without antibiotics (Control) or with antibiotics (Antibiotic) at the terminal ileum. After 25 d experiment, all pigs were euthanized for analyzing bacterial composition and immune status.ResultsIleum terminal antibiotic infusion (ITAI) altered dominant bacteria counts, with a decrease in Bifidobacterium, Clostridium cluster IV and Clostridium cluster IV in the colon (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and an increase in Escherichia coli in the jejunum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). ITAI decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) short-chain fatty acids concentrations in the colon. ITAI decreased interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-10 and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) concentrations, and down-regulated IL-10, Mucin-1\\xa0(MUC1), Mucin-2\\xa0(MUC2) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNA expression in the colonic mucosa (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In the jejunal mucosa, ITAI decreased interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), sIgA and IgG levels together with down-regulation of IFN-γ, TNF-α, MUC2 and ZO-1 mRNA expression (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Furthermore, ITAI decreased IL-10, INF-γ, TNF-α, IgA and IgG concentrations in serum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Correlation analysis revealed that the change in intestinal microbiota was correlated with alterations of Ig and cytokines.ConclusionsITAI affected jejunal and colonic specific bacteria counts, and altered some immune markers levels in the jejunal and colonic mucosa and serum. These findings implicate the potential contribution of hindgut bacteria to immune response in the intestinal mucosa and serum of growing pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundBlack bone sheep was first discovered in Yunnan province of China in 1970, with unique black pigmentation on the body and internal organs. Endothelin 3 (EDN3) has been known as a key gene causing hyperpigmentation in black bone chicken, the Silky fowl.MethodsIn this study, EDN3 was employed as a candidate gene for regulating black color pigmentation. First, EDN3 was cloned from sheep to obtain the full-length cDNA by using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Genomic EDN3 was screened and a total of thirty predicted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped for allele and genotype frequency analysis in a case-control study involving two black bone sheep populations. Genomic copy number analysis of EDN3 in sheep was conducted to measure the variation in copy number. EDN3 expression levels were observed among the groups in adult liver, lymph node, and kidney tissues, as well as embryo kidney samples. Also, among the tissues of black bone and non-black bone sheep.ResultsThe size of the full-length cDNA was 1,578\\xa0bp, which included 426\\xa0bp of 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), an open reading frame (ORF) of 639\\xa0bp encoding a protein of 212 amino acids, and a 3′-UTR of 513\\xa0bp. Genotype and allele frequencies of all the discovered SNPs were found insignificantly different in black bone and non-black bone sheep (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Genomic copy number analysis of EDN3 in sheep revealed no significant difference between the two sheep groups. No significant variations were found in the adult liver and kidney embryo samples. However, the expression in lymph node and kidney tissue was significantly higher in black bone sheep than that in non-black bone sheep (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Significant variations in the EDN3 expression levels were observed among the tissues of non-black bone sheep.ConclusionsThe findings of the present study indicate that unlike in Silky chickens, EDN3 is not responsible for hyperpigmentation but may play a key functional role in immune and excretory systems of black bone sheep.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe aim of the present study was to evaluate CCL8 and CXCL10 expression and its regulatory mechanism in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) at the time of maternal recognition in cows. Blood samples were collected on 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 d after artificial insemination (AI). Based on the day of return of estrus, cows were divided into three groups, pregnant (n\\xa0=\\u20095), early embryonic mortality (EEM; n\\xa0=\\u20095) and late embryonic mortality (LEM; n\\xa0=\\u20095). The gene expression levels in PBLs were assessed with quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR.ResultsThe expression of CCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA in PBLs gradually increased from 14 to 18 d of pregnant cows and significant differences were observed on 18 d (P\\xa0<\\u20090.05), whereas no significant changes were observed both in EEM and LEM cows. Interferon-stimulated protein 15\\xa0kDa (ISG15), myxovirus-resistance gene (MX) 1 and MX2 mRNA expression in PBLs increased from 14 to 18 d which was significant on 18 d of pregnant cows as well as in LEM cows (P\\xa0<\\u20090.05), but no changes were observed in EEM cows. To determine whether the expression of CCL8 and CXCL10 in PBLs was regulated by pregnancy-related substances or not, expression level was assessed after exposure to interferon-τ (IFNT) and CCL16. Monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes were obtained using density-gradient centrifugation and flow cytometry. The addition of IFNT (100\\xa0ng/mL) and CCL16 (100\\xa0ng/mL) to cultured PBLs increased the expression of CCL8 and CXCL10 mRNA (P\\xa0<\\u20090.05). The expression of ISG15, MX1 and MX2 mRNA in PBLs was also stimulated by IFNT and CCL16 (P\\xa0<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe expression of CCL8 and CXCL10 genes increased in PBLs during early pregnancy. Since IFNT stimulated CCL8 and CXCL10 expression in cultured PBLs, the increase of CCL8 and CXCL10 might be pregnancy-dependent events. The expression of both CCL8 and CXCL10 in PBLs was stimulated by CCL16 as well as IFNT, suggesting a chemokine interaction that at least includes CCL8, CXCL10 and CCL16, and may play a role in regulating maternal recognition in cows.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe goat (Caprahircus) is one of the most important livestock animals. Goat milk fat is an important component in the nutritional quality of goat milk. Growing evidence points to the critical roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lipid metabolism.ResultsUsing a highly sensitive method of S-poly(T) plus for miRNAs detection, we analyze the expression patterns of 715 miRNAs in goat mammary gland tissues at different stages of lactation. We observed that miR-25 expression had an inverse relationship with milk production. Overexpression of miR-25 significantly repressed triacylglycerol synthesis and lipid droplet accumulation. To explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-25 in milk lipid metabolism, we analyzed its putative target genes with bioinformatics analysis followed by 3′-UTR assays. Peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 beta (PGC-1beta), a key regulator of lipogenics was identified as a direct target of miR-25 with three specific sites within its 3′-UTR. In addition, miR-25 mimics in goat mammary epithelial cells reduced the expressions of genes involved in lipid metabolism.ConclusionsTaken together, our results show miR-25 is potentially involved in lipid metabolism and we reveal the function of the miR-25/PGC-1beta regulatory axis during lactation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPathogen or diet-induced immune activation can partition energy and nutrients away from growth, but clear relationships between immune responses and the direction and magnitude of energy partitioning responses have yet to be elucidated. The objectives were to determine how β-mannanase supplementation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) immune stimulation affect maintenance energy requirements (MEm) and to characterize immune parameters, digestibility, growth performance, and energy balance.MethodsIn a randomized complete block design, 30 young weaned pigs were assigned to either the control treatment (CON; basal corn, soybean meal and soybean hulls diet), the enzyme treatment (ENZ; basal diet +\\u20090.056% β-mannanase), or the immune system stimulation treatment (ISS; basal diet +\\u20090.056% β-mannanase, challenged with repeated increasing doses of Escherichia coli LPS). The experiment consisted of a 10-d adaptation period, 5-d digestibility and nitrogen balance measurement, 22\\xa0h of heat production (HP) measurements, and 12\\xa0h of fasting HP measurements in indirect calorimetry chambers. The immune challenge consisted of 4 injections of either LPS (ISS) or sterile saline (CON and ENZ), one every 48\\xa0h beginning on d 10. Blood was collected pre- and post-challenge for complete blood counts with differential, haptoglobin and mannan binding lectin, 12 cytokines, and glucose and insulin concentrations.ResultsBeta-mannanase supplementation did not affect immune status, nutrient digestibility, growth performance, energy balance, or MEm. The ISS treatment induced fever, elevated proinflammatory cytokines and decreased leukocyte concentrations (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The ISS treatment did not impact nitrogen balance or nutrient digestibility (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10), but increased total HP (21%) and MEm (23%), resulting in decreased lipid deposition (−30%) and average daily gain (−18%) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThis experiment provides novel data on β-mannanase supplementation effects on immune parameters and energy balance in pigs and is the first to directly relate decreased ADG to increased MEm independent of changes in feed intake in immune challenged pigs. Immune stimulation increased energy partitioning to the immune system by 23% which limited lipid deposition and weight gain. Understanding energy and nutrient partitioning in immune-stressed pigs may provide insight into more effective feeding and management strategies.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe feed conversion ratio (FCR) and residual feed intake (RFI) are common indexes in measuring feed efficiency for livestock. RFI is a feed intake adjusted for requirements for maintenance and production so these two traits are related. Similarly, FCR is related to feed intake and weight gain because it is their ratio. Cholecystokinin type A receptor (CCKAR) plays an important role in animal digestive process. We examined the interplay of these three parameters in a local Chinese chicken population.ResultsThe feed intake (FI) and body weights (BW) of 1,841 individuals were monitored on a daily basis from 56 to 105 d of age. There was a strong correlation between RFI and average daily feed intake (ADFI) and a negative correlation between the FCR and daily gain (rg\\u2009=\\u2009−\\u20090.710). Furthermore, we identified 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CCKAR and 4 of these resulted in amino acid mutations. The C334A mutation was specifically associated with FI and the expected feed intake (EFI) (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01) and significantly associated with the average daily gain (ADG) (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05). G1290A was significantly associated with FI and EFI (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionFCR is apply to weight selecting, and RFI is more appropriate if the breeding focus is feed intake. And C334A and G1290A of the CCKAR gene can be deemed as candidate markers for feed intake and weight gain.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe homeobox containing transcription factor Nanog plays crucial roles in embryonic development/proliferation and/or maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) via interacting with transcription factors such as Oct4 and Sox2 in mammals. However, knowledge of its exact mechanistic pathways remains unexploited. Very little is known about teleost Nanog. Information on the Nanog gene of farmed rohu carp (Labeo rohita) is lacking. We cloned and characterized the Nanog gene of rohu carp to understand the expression pattern in early developmental stages and also deduced the genomic organization including promoter elements.ResultsRohu Nanog (LrNanog) cDNA comprised an open reading frame of 1,161 nucleotides bearing a structural homeodomain; whereas, the genomic structure contained four exons and three introns suggesting that it is homologous to mammalian counterparts. Phylogenetically, it was closely related to freshwater counterparts. Protein sequence (386 AA of 42.65\\xa0kDa) comparison revealed its low similarity with other vertebrate counterparts except that of the conserved homeodomain. Tissue distribution analysis revealed the existence of LrNanog transcripts only in adult gonads. The heightened abundances in the ovary and proliferating spermatogonia suggested its participations in maternal inheritance and male germ cell development. The potentiating abundances from fertilized egg onwards peaking at blastula stage vis- à-vis decreasing levels from gastrula stage onwards demonstrated its role in embryonic stem cell development. We also provided evidence of its presence in\\xa0SSCs by western blotting analysis. Further, the promoter region was characterized, predicting a basal core promoter and other consensus elements.ConclusionThe molecular characterization of LrNanog and its documented expression profiling at transcript and protein levels are indicative of its functional linkage with embryonic/spermatogonial stem cell maintenance. This is the first report of LrNanog genomic organization including its promoter sequence information with predicted regulatory elements of a large-bodied carp species. This will be useful for elucidating its mechanism expression in future. Nanog could be used as a potential biomarker for proliferating carp SSCs.',\n",
       " 'The establishment of pregnancy is a complex process that requires a well-coordinated interaction between the implanting conceptus and the maternal uterus. In pigs, the conceptus undergoes dramatic morphological and functional changes at the time of implantation and introduces various factors, including estrogens and cytokines, interleukin-1β2 (IL1B2), interferon-γ (IFNG), and IFN-δ (IFND), into the uterine lumen. In response to ovarian steroid hormones and conceptus-derived factors, the uterine endometrium becomes receptive to the implanting conceptus by changing its expression of cell adhesion molecules, secretory activity, and immune response. Conceptus-derived estrogens act as a signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy by changing the direction of prostaglandin (PG) F2α from the uterine vasculature to the uterine lumen. Estrogens also induce the expression of many endometrial genes, including genes related to growth factors, the synthesis and transport of PGs, and immunity. IL1B2, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is produced by the elongating conceptus. The direct effect of IL1B2 on endometrial function is not fully understood. IL1B activates the expression of endometrial genes, including the genes involved in IL1B signaling and PG synthesis and transport. In addition, estrogen or IL1B stimulates endometrial expression of IFN signaling molecules, suggesting that estrogen and IL1B act cooperatively in priming the endometrial function of conceptus-produced IFNG and IFND that, in turn, modulate endometrial immune response during early pregnancy. This review addresses information about maternal-conceptus interactions with respect to endometrial gene expression in response to conceptus-derived factors, focusing on the roles of estrogen and IL1B during early pregnancy in pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundInterferon-γ (IFN-γ) is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and bacterial infections. IFN-γ reportedly affects the phagocytic ability of monocytes and macrophages as well as regulates pituitary function in humans and mice. The present study analyzed the impact of IFN-γ on monocyte and macrophage phagocytosis, production performance, and pituitary function in vivo and in vitro (in dwarf chickens). IFN-γ was injected into dwarf chickens through a vein, and then, the laying rate, average egg weight, and levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and IFN-γ were measured in treatment and control groups. For the in vitro experiment, the pituitary tissues were supplemented with IFN-γ, and the mRNA expression levels of follicle-stimulating hormone beta subunit (FSH-β), interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1), and interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFNGR2) in the pituitary were assessed.ResultsMonocyte and macrophage phagocytosis product (PP) was decreased by IFN-γ treatment in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In the in vivo experiment, the level of IFN-γ in the treatment group was higher than that in the control group at 7 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), 14 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), and 21 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) post-injection. Compared with the control group, monocyte and macrophage PP was lower in the treatment group after injection (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).

IFN-γ might be an important regulator in the trade-off between the immune effect and production performance in dwarf chickens.',\n",
       " 'In the past two decades, a considerable amount of research has focused on the determination of the digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) contents of feed ingredients fed to swine. Compared with the DE and ME systems, the net energy (NE) system is assumed to be the most accurate estimate of the energy actually available to the animal. However, published data pertaining to the measured NE content of ingredients fed to growing pigs are limited. Therefore, the Feed Data Group at the Ministry of Agricultural Feed Industry Centre (MAFIC) located at China Agricultural University has evaluated the NE content of many ingredients using indirect calorimetry. The present review summarizes the NE research works conducted at MAFIC and compares these results with those from other research groups on methodological aspect. These research projects mainly focus on estimating the energy requirements for maintenance and its impact on the determination, prediction, and validation of the NE content of several ingredients fed to swine. The estimation of maintenance energy is affected by methodology, growth stage, and previous feeding level. The fasting heat production method and the curvilinear regression method were used in MAFIC to estimate the NE requirement for maintenance. The NE contents of different feedstuffs were determined using indirect calorimetry through standard experimental procedure in MAFIC. Previously generated NE equations can also be used to predict NE in situations where calorimeters are not available. Although popular, the caloric efficiency is not a generally accepted method to validate the energy content of individual feedstuffs. In the future, more accurate and dynamic NE prediction equations aiming at specific ingredients should be established, and more practical validation approaches need to be developed.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundFasting is a simple metabolic strategy that is used to estimate the maintenance energy requirement where the energy supply for basic physiological functions is provided by the mobilization of body reserves. However, the underlying metabolic components of maintenance energy expenditure are not clear. This study investigated the differences in heat production (HP), respiratory quotient (RQ) and plasma metabolites in pigs in the fed and fasted state, using the techniques of indirect calorimetry and metabolomics.MethodsNine barrows (45.2\\u2009±\\u20091.7\\xa0kg BW) were fed corn-soybean based meal diets and were kept in metabolism crates for a period of 14 d. After 7 d adaptation, pigs were transferred to respiratory chambers to determine HP and RQ based on indirect calorimetry. Pigs were fed the diet at 2,400\\xa0kJ ME/(kg BW0.6·d) during d 8 to 12. The last 2\\xa0d were divided into 24\\xa0h fasting and 48\\xa0h fasting treatment, respectively. Plasma samples of each pig were collected from the anterior vena cava during the last 3 d (1 d while pigs were fed and 2 d during which they were fasted). The metabolites of plasma were determined by high-resolution mass spectrometry using a metabolomics approach.ResultsIndirect calorimetry analysis revealed that HP and RQ were no significant difference between 24\\xa0h fasting and 48\\xa0h fasting, which were lower than those of fed state (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.01). The nitrogen concentration of urine tended to decrease with fasting (P\\u2009=\\u20090.054). Metabolomics analysis between the fed and fasted state revealed differences in 15 compounds, most of which were not significantly different between 24\\xa0h fasting and 48\\xa0h fasting. Identified compounds were enriched in metabolic pathways related to linoleic acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis.ConclusionThese results suggest that the decreases in HP and RQ of growing pigs under fasting conditions were associated with the alterations of linoleic acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The integrative analysis also revealed that growing pigs under a 24-h fasting were more appropriate than a 48-h fasting to investigate the metabolic components of maintenance energy expenditure.',\n",

Each treatment contained 10 replicates with 1 gilt per replicate. Gilts were housed in an environmentally controlled room with the partially slatted floor.ResultsDuring the entire experimental period of 28 d, average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of gilts in MO group was significantly reduced compared with those in CO group. The vulva size of gilts was significantly higher in MO group than CO group. In addition, significant increases in the plasma levels of IgA, IgG, IL-8, IL-10 and PRL were determined in MO group compared with that in CO group. ZEA and DON in the diet up-regulated apoptotic caspase-3 in ovaries and uteri, along with down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in ovaries. The supplementation of MBA into diets co-contaminated with ZEA and DON significantly increased ADG, decreased the vulva sizes, reduced the levels of IgG, IL-8 and PRL in plasma, and regulated apoptosis in ovaries and uteri of gilts.ConclusionsThe present results indicated that feeding diet contaminated with ZEA and DON simultaneously (596.86\\xa0μg/kg\\u2009+\\u2009796\\xa0μg/kg) had detrimental effects on growth performance, plasma immune function and reproductive status of gilts.

The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in ruminal bacteria, biopolymer hydrolyzing enzyme activities, and overall performance between the most- and the least-efficient dairy cows during the peripartal period. Twenty multiparous Holstein dairy cows with daily ad libitum access to a total mixed ration from d\\u2009−\\u200910 to d 60 relative to the calving date were used. Cows were classified into most-efficient (i.e. with low RFI, n\\u2009=\\u200910) and least-efficient (i.e. with high RFI, n\\u2009=\\u200910) based on a linear regression model involving dry matter intake (DMI), fat-corrected milk (FCM), changes in body weight (BW), and metabolic BW.ResultsThe most-efficient cows had ~\\u20092.6\\xa0kg/d lower DMI at wk 4, 6, 7, and 8 compared with the least-efficient cows. In addition, the most-efficient cows had greater relative abundance of total ruminal bacterial community during the peripartal period. Compared with the least-efficient cows, the most-efficient cows had 4-fold greater relative abundance of Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens at d\\u2009−\\u200910 and d 10 around parturition and tended to have greater abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Megaspheara elsdenii. In contrast, the relative abundance of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and Streptococcus bovis was lower and Succinimonas amylolytica and Prevotella bryantii tended to be lower in the most-efficient cows around calving. During the peripartal period, the most-efficient cows had lower enzymatic activities of cellulase, amylase, and protease compared with the least-efficient cows.ConclusionsThe results suggest that shifts in ruminal bacteria and digestive enzyme activities during the peripartal period could, at least in part, be part of the mechanism associated with better feed efficiency in dairy cows.',\n",

The induction of cell death was accompanied by activation of unfolded protein response as evidenced by increased protein levels for BiP, p-IRE1α, p-eIF2α, p-JNK, and CHOP. Further study demonstrated that tunicamycin-induced cell death was enhanced by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTORC1. Consistently, tunicamycin decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increased permeability of the cells. These effects of tunicamycin\\xa0were exacerbated by mTORC1 inhibitor.ConclusionsTaken together, the data presented here identified a previously unknown crosstalk between an\\xa0unfold protein response and mTORC1 signaling in the intestinal epithelium. This feed-back loop regulation on ER stress signaling by mTORC1 is critical for cell survival and intestinal permeability in epithelial cells.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundRecent increases in intra-litter variability in weaning weight have raised swine production costs. A contributor to this variability is the normal birth weight pig that grows at a slower rate than littermates of similar birth weight. The goal of this study was to interrogate biochemical profiles manifested in skeletal muscle originating from slow growing (SG) and faster growing littermates (control), with the aim of identifying differences in metabolic pathway utilization between skeletal muscle of the SG pig relative to its littermates. Samples of longissimus muscle from littermate pairs of pigs were collected at 21\\xa0d of age for metabolomic analysis (Metabolon, Inc., Durham, NC).ResultsBirth weights did not differ between littermate pairs of SG and Control pigs (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Weaning weights differed by 1.51\\u2009±\\u20090.19\\xa0kg (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Random forest (RF) analysis was effective at segregating the metabolome of muscle samples by growth rate, resulting in a predictive accuracy of 81% versus random segregation (50%). Decreases in sugars in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in the longissimus of SG pigs were detected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Decreases were also apparent in glycolytic intermediates (glycerol-3-phosphate and lactate) and key glycolysis-derived intermediates (glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate; P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). SG pigs had increased levels of phospholipids, lysolipids, diacylglycerols, and sphingolipids (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Pathway analysis identified a cluster of molecules associated with muscle and collagen/extracellular matrix breakdown that are increased in the SG pig (glutamate, 3-methylhistidine and hydroxylated proline moieties; P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Nicotinate metabolism was altered in SG pigs, resulting in a 78% decrease in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pool (P\\u2009<\\xa00.05).ConclusionsThese metabolomic data provide the first evidence for biochemical mechanisms that should be investigated to determine if they have a potential role in the slow growth in some normal birth weight piglets that contribute to increased intra-litter variability in weaning weights and provides essential information and potential targets for the development of nutritional intervention strategies.',\n",
       " 'Nitrogenous emissions from ruminant livestock production are of increasing public concern and, together with methane, contribute to environmental pollution. The main cause of nitrogen-(N)-containing emissions is the inadequate provision of N to ruminants, leading to an excess of ammonia in the rumen, which is subsequently excreted. Depending on the size and molecular structure, various bacterial, protozoal and fungal species are involved in the ruminal breakdown of nitrogenous compounds (NC). Decelerating ruminal NC degradation by controlling the abundance and activity of proteolytic and deaminating microorganisms, but without reducing cellulolytic processes, is a promising strategy to decrease N emissions along with increasing N utilization by ruminants. Different dietary options, including among others the treatment of feedstuffs with heat or the application of diverse feed additives, as well as vaccination against rumen microorganisms or their enzymes have been evaluated. Thereby, reduced productions of microbial metabolites, e.g. ammonia, and increased microbial N flows give evidence for an improved N retention. However, linkage between these findings and alterations in the rumen microbiota composition, particularly NC-degrading microbes, remains sparse and contradictory findings confound the exact evaluation of these manipulating strategies, thus emphasizing the need for comprehensive research. The demand for increased sustainability in ruminant livestock production requests to apply attention to microbial N utilization efficiency and this will require a better understanding of underlying metabolic processes as well as composition and interactions of ruminal NC-degrading microorganisms.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundResveratrol, a plant phenol, affords protection against inflammation and oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary resveratrol supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the antioxidant status of sows and piglets and on antioxidant gene expression and pathway in placenta.MethodsForty sows were allotted to 2 dietary treatments 20 d after breeding. Sows were fed a control diet and a control diet with 300\\xa0mg/kg resveratrol. Oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant enzymes were measured in the placenta, milk, and plasma of sows and piglets. Antioxidant gene expression and protein expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Keap1-Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa B-p65 (NFκB-p65) and sirtuin1 (Sirt1) were quantified in the placenta.ResultsDietary resveratrol increased the litter and piglets weaning weights. Antioxidant status in the milk, placenta and plasma of sows and piglets was partially improved by dietary resveratrol. In placenta, Nrf2 protein expression was increased and Keap1 protein expression was decreased by dietary resveratrol. The mRNA expression of antioxidant genes including catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), GPX4, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), and phase 2 detoxification genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM), microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1(MGST1) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was increased by dietary resveratrol. Dietary resveratrol also increased Sirt1 and phosphorylated NFκB-p65 protein expression in the placenta. We failed to observe any influences of dietary resveratrol on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including those of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). However, we observed that the mRNA expression of IL-8 in placenta was reduced by maternal resveratrol. In addition, dietary resveratrol showed interactive effects with day of lactation on activities of SOD and CAT and levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in milk.ConclusionsDietary resveratrol supplementation during pregnancy and lactation improves the antioxidant status of sows and piglets, which is beneficial to the reproductive performance of sows. Dietary resveratrol regulates placental antioxidant gene expression by the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and Sirt1 in placenta.',\n",

These animals were assigned to different periods of HG diet (containing 40% forage and 60% concentrate mix) feeding. The HG groups received an HG diet for 7 (G7, n\\u2009=\\u20095), 14 (G14, n\\u2009=\\u20095) and 28 d (G28, n\\u2009=\\u20095), respectively. In contrast, the control group (CON, n\\u2009=\\u20095) was fed the forage-based diet for 28\\xa0d. The results showed that HG feeding linearly decreased (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001) the ruminal pH, and increased the concentrations of ruminal total volatile fatty acid (linear, P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), butyrate (linear, P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001), valerate (quadratic P\\u2009=\\u20090.029) and the level of IGF-1 (quadratic, P\\u2009=\\u20090.043) in plasma. The length (quadratic, P\\u2009=\\u20090.004), width (cubic, P\\u2009=\\u20090.015) and surface of the ruminal papillae (linear, P\\u2009=\\u20090.003) were all enlarged after 14 d of HG diet feeding. HG feeding cubically increased the number of cell layers forming the stratum corneum (SC, P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001) and the thickness of the SC (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001) and stratum basale (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001). The proportion of basal layer cells in the RE decreased (linear, P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.001) in the G0/G1-phase, but it increased linearly (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006) in the S-phase and cubically (P\\u2009=\\u20090.004) in the G2/M-phases. The proportion of apoptosis cells in G7, G14 and G28 was reduced compared to the CON (quadratic, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). HG diet feeding linearly decreased the mRNA expression of Cyclin E1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.021) and CDK-2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and (P\\u2009=\\u20090.027) the protein expression of Cyclin E1. Feeding an HG diet linearly increased the mRNA expression of genes IGFBP-2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.034) and IGFBP 5 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.009), while linearly decreasing (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) the IGFBP 3 expression.

       " 'BackgroundAcquisition of pluripotency by transcriptional regulatory factors is an initial developmental event that is required for regulation of cell fate and lineage specification during early embryonic development. The evolutionarily conserved core transcriptional factors regulating the pluripotency network in fishes, amphibians, and mammals have been elucidated. There are also species-specific maternally inherited transcriptional factors and their intricate transcriptional networks important in the acquisition of pluripotency. In avian species, however, the core transcriptional network that governs the acquisition of pluripotency during early embryonic development is not well understood.ResultsWe found that chicken NANOG (cNANOG) was expressed in the stages between the pre-ovulatory follicle and oocyte and was continuously detected in Eyal-Giladi and Kochav stage I (EGK.I) to X. However, cPOUV was not expressed during folliculogenesis, but began to be detectable between EGK.V and VI. Unexpectedly, cSOX2 could not be detected during folliculogenesis and intrauterine embryonic development. Instead of cSOX2, cSOX3 was maternally inherited and continuously expressed during chicken intrauterine development. In addition, we found that the pluripotency-related genes such as cENS-1, cKIT, cLIN28A, cMYC, cPRDM14, and cSALL4 began to be dramatically upregulated between EGK.VI and VIII.ConclusionThese results suggest that chickens have a unique pluripotent circuitry since maternally inherited cNANOG and cSOX3 may play an important role in the initial acquisition of pluripotency. Moreover, the acquisition of pluripotency in chicken embryos occurs at around EGK.VI to VIII.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundMilk protein is crucial for milk quality in sows and health of newborn piglets. Plasma amino acids (AA) in sows are important precursors for milk protein synthesis in the mammary gland. In order to study the regulation of AA transported in sow mammary glands and possible underlying mechanisms, we measured the expression of genes coding for milk proteins, AA transporter expressions, and plasma AA concentrations in sows at three different physiological stages (D-17, D1 and D17 of lactation), and then further investigated the regulation of AA transport across the cell membrane by adaptive mechanisms using pig mammary epithelial cells (PMEC) as an in vitro model. PMEC were cultured in DMEM:F12 with 4 amino acid concentrations (0\\u2009×\\u2009AA complex, 1\\u2009×\\u2009AA complex, 5\\u2009×\\u2009AA complex, and 25\\u2009×\\u2009AA complex). Classes of AA complexes evaluated in this study included neutral AAs (L-Ala + L-Ser\\u2009+\\u2009L-Cys), acidic AAs (L-Asp, L-Glu) and neutral + basic AAs (L-Ala + L-Ser\\u2009+\\u2009L-Cys\\u2009+\\u2009L-Lys).ResultsOur results indicated that mRNA expression of genes coding for milk protein (αs1-casein, αs2-casein, β-casein and κ-casein) increased significantly with the advance of physiological stage (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and plasma concentrations of most AAs including threonine, serine, glutamate, alanine, valine, cysteine, methionine, isoleucine and tyrosine were greater at D1 of lactation compared with D-17 and D17 of lactation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, protein and gene expressions of AA transporters including excitatory AA transporter 3 (EAAT3), alanine/serine/cysteine/threonine transporter (ASCT1) and sodium-coupled neutral AA transporter 1 (SNAT2) were greater in lactating sow mammary glands compared with sow mammary glands in late pregnancy (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The mRNA expressions of SLC38A2, SLC1A1, SLC6A14 increased significantly in the cell mediums supplemented with 5\\u2009×\\u2009and 25\\u2009×\\u2009of AA complexes compared with those cells cultured in DMEM/F12 cell medium (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The mRNA expressions of SLC38A, SLC1A4, and SLC6A14 also increased in EBSS cell medium compared to DMEM/F12. However, only mRNA expression of SLC38A decreased when AA complex was added into EBSS (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionAA transportation was positively regulated in sow mammary glands with the advance of physiological stage from late pregnancy to peak of lactation and AA transporters in PMECs were adaptively regulated by changed AA concentrations.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundSoybean meal is an excellent and cost-effective protein source; however, its usage is limited in the piglet due to the presence of anti-nutritional factors and the antigens glycinin and β-conglycinin. The objective of the current study was to screen and select for bacteria that can be efficiently adopted to ferment soybean meal in order to solve this problem.ResultsBacteria were isolated from fermented soy foods and the grass carp intestine, and strains selected for high protease, cellulase and amylase activities. The isolated bacteria were characterized as Bacillus cereus,\\xa0Bacillus subtilis and Bacilus amyloliquefacien, respectively. Fermentation with food-derived Isolate-2 and fish-derived F-9 increased crude protein content by 5.32% and 8.27%, respectively; improved the amino acid profile by increasing certain essential amino acids, broke down larger soy protein to 35\\xa0kDa and under, eliminated antigenicity against glycinin and β-conglycinin, and removed raffinose and stachyose in the soybean meal following a 24-h fermentation.ConclusionsOur results suggest these two B. amyloliquefaciens bacteria can efficiently solid state ferment soybean meal and ultimately produce a more utilizable food source for growing healthy piglets.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe degree of adipose tissue development at birth may influence neonatal survival and subsequent health outcomes. Despite their lower birth weights, piglets from Meishan sows (a fat breed with excellent maternal ability) have a higher survival rate than piglets from Large White sows (a lean breed). To identify the main pathways involved in subcutaneous adipose tissue maturation during the last month of gestation, we compared the proteome and the expression levels of some genes at d\\xa090 and d\\xa0110 of gestation in purebred and crossbred Large White or Meishan fetuses gestated by sows of either breed.ResultsA total of 52 proteins in fetal subcutaneous adipose tissue were identified as differentially expressed over the course of gestation. Many proteins involved in energy metabolism were more abundant, whereas some proteins participating in cytoskeleton organization were reduced in abundance on d\\xa0110 compared with d\\xa090. Irrespective of age, 24 proteins differed in abundance between fetal genotypes, and an interaction effect between fetal age and genotype was observed for 13 proteins. The abundance levels of proteins known to be responsive to nutrient levels such as aldolase and fatty acid binding proteins, as well as the expression levels of FASN, a key lipogenic enzyme, and MLXIPL, a pivotal transcriptional mediator of glucose-related stimulation of lipogenic genes, were elevated in the adipose tissue of pure and crossbred fetuses from Meishan sows. These data suggested that the adipose tissue of these fetuses had superior metabolic functionality, whatever their paternal genes. Conversely, proteins participating in redox homeostasis and apoptotic cell clearance had a lower abundance in Meishan than in Large White fetuses. Time-course differences in adipose tissue protein abundance were revealed between fetal genotypes for a few secreted proteins participating in responses to organic substances, such as alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, transferrin and albumin.ConclusionsThese results underline the importance of not only fetal age but also maternal intrauterine environment in the regulation of several proteins in subcutaneous adipose tissue. These proteins may be used to estimate the maturity grade of piglet neonates.',\n",

Lactobacilli show beneficial effects on intestinal health in infectious disease, but the protective functions of lactobacilli in C. perfringens-infected chickens are scarcely described. This study examined the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) on the growth performance and intestinal health of broiler chickens challenged with Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) over a 28-day period. Using a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement of treatments, a total of 308 1-day-old male Arbor Acres broiler chicks were included to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) on the growth performance and intestinal health of broiler chickens challenged with Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) during a 28-day trial.ResultsDuring infection (d 14–21), C. perfringens challenge decreased the average daily gain (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05), and increased feed conversion ratio and the mortality rate (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05). However, dietary supplementation with L. acidophilus increased the body weight of C. perfringens-infected broilers on d 21 (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05), and tended to decrease the mortality (P\\u2009=\\u20090.061). C. perfringens challenge decreased the villus height (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05), the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05) and OCLN (occludin) mRNA expression (P\\u2009<\\u2009\\xa00.05), and increased the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the spleen and jejunum, the intestinal populations of C. perfringens and Escherichia (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and the serum content of endotoxin (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), regardless of L. acidophilus supplementation. In contrast, dietary L. acidophilus reducedthe intestinal lesion score of challenged broilers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ileal populations of Escherichia and serum endotoxin content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), but increased the intestinal Lactobacillus populations (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), irrespective of C. perfringens challenge.ConclusionDietary addition of L. acidophilus could improve the intestinal health and reduce the mortality of broilers suffering from necrotic enteritis.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundGenome-wide association studies and genomic predictions are thought to be optimized by using whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. However, sequencing thousands of individuals of interest is expensive. Imputation from SNP panels to WGS data is an attractive and less expensive approach to obtain WGS data. The aims of this study were to investigate the accuracy of imputation and to provide insight into the design and execution of genotype imputation.ResultsWe genotyped 450 chickens with a 600\\xa0K SNP array, and sequenced 24 key individuals by whole genome re-sequencing. Accuracy of imputation from putative 60\\xa0K and 600\\xa0K array data to WGS data was 0.620 and 0.812 for Beagle, and 0.810 and 0.914 for FImpute, respectively. By increasing the sequencing cost from 24X to 144X, the imputation accuracy increased from 0.525 to 0.698 for Beagle and from 0.654 to 0.823 for FImpute. With fixed sequence depth (12X), increasing the number of sequenced animals from 1 to 24, improved accuracy from 0.421 to 0.897 for FImpute and from 0.396 to 0.777 for Beagle. Using optimally selected key individuals resulted in a higher imputation accuracy compared with using randomly selected individuals as a reference population for re-sequencing. With fixed reference population size (24), imputation accuracy increased from 0.654 to 0.875 for FImpute and from 0.512 to 0.762 for Beagle as the sequencing depth increased from 1X to 12X. With a given total cost of genotyping, accuracy increased with the size of the reference population for FImpute, but the pattern was not valid for Beagle, which showed the highest accuracy at six fold coverage for the scenarios used in this study.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we comprehensively investigated the impacts of several key factors on genotype imputation. Generally, increasing sequencing cost gave a higher imputation accuracy. But with a fixed sequencing cost, the optimal imputation enhance the performance of WGP and GWAS. An optimal imputation strategy should take size of reference population, imputation algorithms, marker density, and population structure of the target population and methods to select key individuals into consideration comprehensively. This work sheds additional light on how to design and execute genotype imputation for livestock populations.',\n",

After birth, piglets born live were classified as low birth-weight (LBW; <\\u20091\\xa0kg) and normal birth-weight (NBW; ≥1\\xa0kg). During the growing phase, 240 control and 230 underfed pigs (50% males and females) distributed by BW category and sex were studied until the slaughter.ResultsAt birth and weaning, there were significant differences in all morphological measures and weight between NBW and LBW piglets as expected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0005), but few effects of the gestational feed restriction. During the growing phase, NBW pigs continued with higher weight than LBW pigs on all the days of evaluation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), even though control-LBW-females and LBW-males showed a catch-up growth.

GC has profound effects on plasma glucose level and other metabolic conditions.

The results showed that plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly increased after Dex administration (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, the content of hepatic glycogen was also markedly increased in Dex-treated goats (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), while the content of glycogen in dorsal longissimus was unchanged by Dex (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). The expression of several key genes, involved in blood glucose regulation, was detected by real-time PCR in the small intestine, skeletal muscle and liver. The expression of glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2), sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and sodium-potassium ATPase (Na-K/ATPase) in the small intestine were generally increased by Dex, and GLUT2 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In liver, the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis including glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC), cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC), were significantly down-regulated by Dex. However, the protein expression levels of PCK1 & PCK2 were significantly increased by Dex, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. In dorsal longissimus, the mRNA expression of genes associated with gluconeogenesis and the insulin signaling pathway were generally up-regulated by Dex, but the mRNA expression of two markers of muscle atrophy, namely F-box protein 32 (FBXO32/Atrogin1) and muscle RING-finger protein 1 (MuRF1), was not altered by Dex.ConclusionsTaken together, these results indicate that chronic administration of a low dosage of Dex induces hyperglycemia mainly through gluconeogenesis activation in the goat liver.',\n",

Twelve Holstein cows were used in a replicated 3\\u2009×\\u20093 Latin square design with three dietary treatments: (1) low-NFC diet (NFC\\u2009=\\u200935.6%, L-NFC), (2) high-NFC diet (NFC\\u2009=\\u200940.1%, H-NFC), and (3) alfalfa hay diet (NFC\\u2009=\\u200938.9%, AH).ResultsIntake of DM was lower for cows fed H-NFC compared to L-NFC and AH, while the milk yield was higher in AH than in H-NFC and L-NFC (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The feed efficiency (milk yield/DM intake, 1.15 vs. 1.08, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) were greater for cows fed H-NFC than L-NFC. The contents of milk protein and lactose were not different among the groups (P\\u2009>\\u20090.11), but milk fat content was higher for cows fed H-NFC and L-NFC compared to AH (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration and the concentrations of urea nitrogen in blood and milk were lower for cows fed H-NFC and AH compared to L-NFC (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

However, little is known about BA’s effects on piglets with intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR). Therefore, this study investigated the effects of BA supplementation on the growth performance, intestinal morphology, inflammatory response, and microbiota of IUGR piglets.MethodsEighteen litters of newborn piglets were selected at birth, with one normal birth weight (NBW) and two IUGR piglets in each litter (i.e., 18 NBW and 36 IUGR piglets in total). At weaning, the NBW piglet and one of the IUGR piglets were assigned to groups fed a control diet (i.e., the NBW-CON and IUGR-CON groups). The other IUGR piglet was assigned to a group fed the control diet supplemented with 2.0\\xa0g BA per kg of diet (i.e., IUGR-BA group). The piglets were thus distributed across three groups for a four-week period.ResultsIUGR reduced the growth performance of the IUGR-CON piglets compared with the NBW-CON piglets. It was also associated with decreased villus sizes, increased apoptosis rates, reduced goblet cell numbers, and an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the small intestine. Supplementation with BA improved the average daily weight gain and the feed efficiency of the IUGR-BA group compared with the IUGR-CON group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The IUGR-BA group exhibited increases in the ratio of jejunal villus height to crypt depth, in ileal villus height, and in ileal goblet cell density. They also exhibited decreases in the numbers of jejunal and ileal apoptotic cells and ileal proliferative cells (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Supplementation with BA increased interleukin 10 content, but it decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha level in the small intestines of the IUGR-BA piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Furthermore, compared with the IUGR-CON piglets, the IUGR-BA piglets had less Escherichia coli in their jejunal digesta, but more Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in their ileal digesta (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsDietary supplementation with BA improves morphology, decreases inflammatory response, and regulates microbiota in the small intestines of IUGR piglets, which may contribute to improved growth performance during early life.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe effect of amylases combined with exogenous carbohydrase and protease in a newly harvested corn diet on starch digestibility, intestine health and cecal microbiota was investigated in broiler chickens.MethodsTwo hunderd and eighty-eight 5-day-old female chickens were randomly divided into six treatments: a newly harvested corn-soybean meal diet (control); control supplemented with 1,500\\xa0U/g α-amylase (Enzyme A); Enzyme A\\u2009+\\u2009300\\xa0U/g amylopectase +\\u200920,000\\xa0U/g glucoamylase (Enzyme B); Enzyme B\\u2009+\\u2009protease 10,000\\xa0U/g (Enzyme C); Enzyme C\\u2009+\\u2009xylanase 15,000\\xa0U/g (Enzyme D); and Enzyme D\\u2009+\\u2009cellulase 200\\xa0U/g\\u2009+\\u2009pectinase 1,000 U/g (Enzyme E). Growth performance, starch digestibility, digestive organ morphology, and intestinal microbiota were evaluated in the birds at 16 and 23 d of age.ResultsCompared with the control diet, supplementation with Enzyme A significantly decreased ileum lesion scoring at 16 d of age (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05); supplementation with Enzyme B or Enzyme C showed positive effects on ileal amylopectin and total starch digestibility (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05); Broilers fed with a diet supplemented with Enzyme D had a tendency to decrease body weight gain at 23 d. Enzyme E supplementation improved lesion scoring of jejunum and ileum at 16 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and increased ileal amylopectin or total starch digestibility at 23 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

High numbers of Campylobacter, Helicobacter and Butyricicoccus, Anaerostipes and Bifidobacterium, Sutterella and Odoribacter were the main genera detected in supplementations with Enzymes B, C, D, and E respectively.ConclusionsSupplementation with amylase combined with glucoamylase or protease showed a beneficial effect on starch digestibility and intestinal microbiota diversity, and increased growth of broilers fed with newly harvested corn.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundColostrum is the first secretion produced by mammary glands during the hours immediately preceding and succeeding parturition. This secretion differs from milk and represents an essential vehicle of passive immunity, prebiotic compounds and growth factors involved in intestinal development. Most of the literature concerning colostrum composition refers mainly to human and cow; and little is known about pig colostrum metabolome and how it varies between pig breeds and different farrowing parity. Thus, the aim of the present research is to provide new information about pig colostrum composition and the associations between metabolites, the sows’ breed and the survival and growth rates of their litters.ResultsColostrum samples were gathered from 58 parturitions of sows belonging to three different breeds chosen for their importance in Italian heavy pig production: 31 Large White, 15 Landrace and 12 Duroc respectively. The defatted and ultrafiltered colostrum samples were analysed using 1H–NMR spectroscopy. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was assessed on the obtained spectra. In addition, using a Stepwise Regression and a Linear Regression analyses the metabolites named after the signals assignment were tested for their associations with piglets’ performances. Twenty-five metabolites were identified, comprehending monosaccharides, disaccharides (such as lactose), organic acids (lactate, citrate, acetate and formate), nitrogenous organic acids (such as creatine) and other compounds, including nucleotides. PCA results evidence a clustering due to breed and season effects. Lactose was the main compound determining the assignment of the samples into different clusters according to the sow breed. Furthermore, some metabolites showed to be associated with piglets’ performance and survival traits: acetate and taurine were positively related to litter weight gain and piglets’ survival rate, respectively, while dimethylamine and cis-aconitate were linked to new-borns’ impaired ability to survive.ConclusionsThe results obtained suggest that colostrum composition is affected by breed, which, together with environmental conditions, may cause changes in colostrum metabolites content with possible consequences on piglets’ performances. Among the identified metabolites, acetate, taurine, dimethylamine and cis-aconitate showed consistent associations with piglets’ survival rate and litter weight gain, implying that these compounds may affect new-borns’ ability to survive.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn rumen fermentation, fumaric acid (FA) could competitively utilize hydrogen with methanogenesis to enhance propionate production and suppress methane emission, but both effects were diet-dependent. This study aimed to explore the effects of FA supplementation on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation in goats fed diets varying in forage and concentrate particle size.MethodsFour rumen-cannulated goats were used in a 4\\u2009×\\u20094 Latin square design with a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement of treatments: low or high ratio of forage particle size: concentrate particle size (Fps:Cps), without or with FA supplementation (24\\xa0g/d). Fps:Cps was higher in the diet with chopped alfalfa hay plus ground corn than in that with ground alfalfa hay plus crushed corn.ResultsBoth increasing dietary Fps:Cps and FA supplementation shifted ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) patterns toward more propionate and less acetate in goats. An interaction between dietary Fps:Cps and FA supplementation was observed for the ratio of acetate to propionate (A:P), which was more predominant when FA was supplemented in the low-Fps:Cps diet. Methane production was reduced by FA, and the reduction was larger in the low-Fps:Cps diet (31.72%) than in the high-Fps:Cps diet (17.91%). Fumaric acid decreased ruminal total VFA concentration and increased ruminal pH. No difference was found in ruminal DM degradation of concentrate or alfalfa hay by dietary Fps:Cps or FA. Goats presented a lower ruminal methanogen abundance with FA supplementation and a higher B. fibrisolvens abundance with high dietary Fps:Cps.ConclusionsAdjusting dietary Fps:Cps is an alternative dietary model for studying diet-dependent effects without changing dietary chemical composition. Fumaric acid supplementation in the low-Fps:Cps diet showed greater responses in methane mitigation and propionate increase.',\n",
       " 'The tools available for genome engineering have significantly improved over the last 5\\xa0years, allowing scientist to make precise edits to the genome. Along with the development of these new genome editing tools has come advancements in technologies used to deliver them. In mammals genome engineering tools are typically delivered into in vitro fertilized single cell embryos which are subsequently cultured and then implanted into a recipient animal. In avian species this is not possible, so other methods have been developed for genome engineering in birds. The most common involves in vitro culturing of primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are cells that migrate through the embryonic circulatory system to the developing gonad and colonize the gonad, eventually differentiating into the gonadocytes which produce either sperm or ova. While in culture the PGCs can be modified to carry novel transgenes or gene edits, the population can be screened and enriched, and then transferred into a recipient embryo. The largest drawback of PGC culture is that culture methods do not transfer well across avian species, thus there are reliable culture methods for only a few species including the chicken. Two newer technologies that appear to be more easily adapted in a wider range of avian species are direct injection and sperm transfection assisted gene editing (STAGE). The direct injection method involves injecting genome engineering tools into the circulatory system of the developing embryo just prior to the developmental time point when the PGCs are migrating to the gonads. The genome engineering tools are complexed with transfection reagents, allowing for in vivo transfection of the PGCs. STAGE utilizes sperm transfection to deliver genome engineering tools directly to the newly fertilized embryo. Preliminary evidence indicates that both methodologies have the potential to be adapted for use in birds species other than the chicken, however further work is needed in this area.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundExtensive degradation of amino acids in the rumen via microbial deamination decreases\\xa0the post-ruminal availability of dietary indispensable amino acids. Together with the normal decrease in voluntary dry matter intake (DMI) around parturition in dairy cows, microbial metabolism contributes to a markedly negative balance of indispensable amino acids, including methionine which may\\xa0be the first-limiting for milk production. The main objective of the current study was to profile changes in major bacterial species with key functions in cellulose and hemicellulose digestion, xylan breakdown, proteolytic action, propionic acid production, lactate utilization and ruminal biohydrogenation in cows supplemented with rumen-protected Methionine (SM; Smartamine M, Adisseo NA, Alpharetta, GA, USA) from −23 through 30 d relative to parturition. Because ~90% of the methionine in SM bypasses the rumen, ~10% of the methionine is released into the rumen and can be utilized by microbes.ResultsAs expected, there was an increase in overall DMI after parturition (Day, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) during which cows consumed on average 19.6\\xa0kg/d versus 13.9\\xa0kg/d in the prepartum period. The postpartum diet contained greater concentrations of lipid and highly-fermentable carbohydrate from corn grain, which likely explains the increases in the relative\\xa0abundance of Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, and Succinimonas amylolytica. Despite similar DMI prepartum, cows fed SM had greater (Treatment\\xa0× Day, P < 0.05)\\xa0abundance prepartum\\xa0of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Succinimonas amylolytica, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens. However, the greater DMI in cows fed SM after parturition (19.6\\xa0kg/d versus 13.9\\xa0kg/d) was associated with lower abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes (2.13 × 10−3 versus 2.25 × 10−4) and Selenomonas ruminantium (2.98 × 10−1 versus 4.10 × 10−1). A lower abundance (Day, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) was detected on d 20 compared with d\\xa0−10\\xa0for Fibrobacter succinogenes and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens. The relative abundance of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus and Eubacterium ruminantium was stable across treatment and time.ConclusionsIn diets with proper balance of rumen-degradable protein and fermentable carbohydrate, the small fraction of Methionine released from the rumen-protected supplement did not seem to compromise growth of major bacterial species in the rumen. In fact, it had a positive effect on 3 major species prepartum when DMI was similar between groups. Because the actual requirements of Methionine (and Lysine, for example) by the cow during the transition period are unknown, it appears warranted to study the rumen microbiome as it relates to supply of rumen-protected amino acids.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundSemen evaluation is used to estimate the testicular function. In bulls, the spermatozoa present in the ejaculate are the result of a process that begun more than 2 mo earlier, bequeathing a delayed depiction of the actual function of the testis. Since testis vascularization might be critical for the gonad function, selected pulse wave Doppler ultrasound parameters were assessed in this study, for instance the peak systolic velocity, the end diastolic velocity and the resistive index of the testicular artery along the spermatic cord, the marginal portion of the testicular artery and the intratesticular branches of the testicular artery both in healthy adult and young bulls. Correlations between these parameters and characteristics of semen that was collected numerous times, before and after the Doppler ultrasound examination.ResultsThe peak systolic velocity and the end diastolic velocity measured in the testicular artery along the spermatic cord (supratesticular artery – SA) were variable among the bulls and within individual bulls, likely due to the convoluted course of the vessel. The resistive index was found highly repeatable in the same bull. A reduction in the resistive index was found between the supratesticular artery and the marginal portion of the testicular artery (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), and between the marginal portion of the testicular artery and the intratesticular branches of the testicular artery (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). No differences were recorded for the pulse wave Doppler ultrasound parameters in young bulls compared with adults. A significant correlation was found between the resistive index of the marginal portion of the testicular artery and total sperm in the ejaculate (r\\u2009=\\u20090.516, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), the immature sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.462, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), the teratoid sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.375, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and the “Dag defect” sperm (r\\u2009=\\u20090.389, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

       " 'Transgenesis and genome editing in birds are based on a unique germline transmission system using primordial germ cells (PGCs), which is quite different from the mammalian transgenic and genome editing system. PGCs are progenitor cells of gametes that can deliver genetic information to the next generation. Since avian PGCs were first discovered in nineteenth century, there have been numerous efforts to reveal their origin, specification, and unique migration pattern, and to improve germline transmission efficiency. Recent advances in the isolation and in vitro culture of avian PGCs with genetic manipulation and genome editing tools enable the development of valuable avian models that were unavailable before. However, many challenges remain in the production of transgenic and genome-edited birds, including the precise control of germline transmission, introduction of exogenous genes, and genome editing in PGCs. Therefore, establishing reliable germline-competent PGCs and applying precise genome editing systems are critical current issues in the production of avian models. Here, we introduce a historical overview of avian PGCs and their application, including improved techniques and methodologies in the production of transgenic and genome-edited birds, and we discuss the future potential applications of transgenic and genome-edited birds to provide opportunities and benefits for humans.',\n",
       " 'The production of transgenic farm animals (e.g., cattle) via genome engineering for the gain or loss of gene functions is an important undertaking. In the initial stages of genome engineering, DNA micro-injection into one-cell stage embryos (zygotes) followed by embryo transfer into a recipient was performed because of the ease of the procedure. However, as this approach resulted in severe mosaicism and has a low efficiency, it is not typically employed in the cattle as priority, unlike in mice. To overcome the above issue with micro-injection in cattle, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) was introduced and successfully used to produce cloned livestock. The application of SCNT for the production of transgenic livestock represents a significant advancement, but its development speed is relatively slow because of abnormal reprogramming and low gene targeting efficiency. Recent genome editing technologies (e.g., ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR-Cas9) have been rapidly adapted for applications in cattle and great results have been achieved in several fields such as disease models and bioreactors. In the future, genome engineering technologies will accelerate our understanding of genetic traits in bovine and will be readily adapted for bio-medical applications in cattle.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPregnancy is associated with important changes in gut microbiota composition. Dietary factors may affect the diversity, composition, and metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota. Among amino acids, proline is known to play important roles in protein metabolism and structure, cell differentiation, conceptus growth and development, and gut microbiota re-equilibration in case of dysbiosis.ResultsDietary supplementation with 1% proline decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) the amounts of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Peptostreptococcus productus, Pseudomonas, and Veillonella spp. in distal colonic contents than that in the control group. The colonic contents of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, Clostridium leptum subgroup, Escherichia coli, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, and Prevotella increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on d 70 of pregnancy as compared with those on d 45 of pregnancy. The colonic concentrations of acetate, total straight-chain fatty acid, and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the proline-supplemented group were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and butyrate level (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) decreased as compared with the control group. Almost all of the SCFA displayed higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentrations in proximal colonic contents on d 70 of pregnancy than those on d 45 of pregnancy. The concentrations of 1,7-heptyl diamine (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) and phenylethylamine (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in proximal colonic contents were higher, while those of spermidine (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) and total bioamine (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) tended to be lower in the proline-supplemented group than those in the control group. The concentrations of spermidine, spermine, and total bioamine in colonic contents were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on d 70 of pregnancy than those measured on d 45 of pregnancy. In contrast, the concentration of phenylethylamine was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on d 70 than on d 45 of pregnancy.ConclusionThese findings indicate that L-proline supplementation modifies both the colonic microbiota composition and the luminal concentrations of several bacterial metabolites. Furthermore, our data show that both the microbiota composition and the concentrations of bacterial metabolites are evolving in the course of pregnancy. These results are discussed in terms of possible implication in terms of luminal environment and consequences for gut physiology and health.',\n",
       " 'Pigs are an important resource in agriculture and serve as a model for human diseases. Due to their physiological and anatomical similarities with humans, pigs can recapitulate symptoms of human diseases, making them a useful model in biomedicine. However, in the past pig models have not been widely used partially because of the difficulty in genetic modification. The lack of true embryonic stem cells in pigs forced researchers to utilize genetic modification in somatic cells and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to generate genetically engineered (GE) pigs carrying site-specific modifications. Although possible, this approach is extremely inefficient and GE pigs born through this method often presented developmental defects associated with the cloning process. Advancement in the gene-editing systems such as Zinc-Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) system have dramatically increased the efficiency of producing GE pigs. These gene-editing systems, specifically engineered endonucleases, are based on inducing double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at a specific location, and then site-specific modifications can be introduced through one of the two DNA repair pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology direct repair (HDR). Random insertions or deletions (indels) can be introduced through NHEJ and specific nucleotide sequences can be introduced through HDR, if donor DNA is provided. Use of these engineered endonucleases provides a higher success in genetic modifications, multiallelic modification of the genome, and an opportunity to introduce site-specific modifications during embryogenesis, thus bypassing the need of SCNT in GE pig production. This review will provide a historical prospective of GE pig production and examples of how the gene-editing system, led by engineered endonucleases, have improved GE pig production. We will also present some of our current progress related to the optimal use of CRISPR/Cas9 system during embryogenesis.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn order to discover new strategies to replace antibiotics in the post-antibiotic era in meat-type chicken production, two new synbiotics were tested: (Lactobacillus salivarius IBB3154 plus galactooligosaccharide (Syn1) and Lactobacillus plantarum IBB3036 plus raffinose family oligosaccharides (Syn2).MethodsThe synbiotics were administered via syringe, using a special automatic system, into the egg air chamber of Cobb 500 broiler chicks on the 12th day of egg incubation (2 mg of prebiotics + 105 cfu bacteria per egg). Hatched roosters (total 2,400) were reared on an experimental farm, kept in pens (75 animals per pen), with free access to feed and water. After 42 d animals were slaughtered. Blood serum, pancreas, duodenum and duodenum content were collected.ResultsSyn2 increased trypsin activity by 2.5-fold in the pancreas and 1.5-fold in the duodenal content. In the duodenum content, Syn2 resulted in ca 30% elevation in lipase activity and 70% reduction in amylase activity. Syn1 and Syn2 strongly decreased expression of mRNA for GLP-1 and GIP in the duodenum and for GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas. Simultaneously, concentrations of the incretins significantly diminished in the blood serum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The decreased expression of incretins coincides with changed activity of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and in the duodenal content. The results indicate that incretins are involved in the action of Syn1 and Syn2 or that they may even be their target. No changes were observed in key hormones regulating metabolism (insulin, glucagon, corticosterone, thyroid hormones, and leptin) or in metabolic indices (glucose, NEFA, triglycerides, cholesterol). Additionally, synbiotics did not cause significant changes in the activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases in broiler chickens. Simultaneously, the activity of alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase diminished after Syn2 and Syn1, respectively.ConclusionThe selected synbiotics may be used as in ovo additives for broiler chickens, and Syn2 seems to improve their potential digestive proteolytic and lipolytic ability. Our results suggest that synbiotics can be directly or indirectly involved in incretin secretion and reception.',\n",

Two hundred and forty 1-day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned to a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement with two dietary B. coagulans levels (0 or 4\\u2009×\\u2009109\\xa0CFU/kg of diet) and two disease challenge statuses (control or NE challenged).ResultsNE-induced reduction in body weight gain was relieved by the addition of B. coagulans into broiler diets compared with the NE-infected birds. NE infection damaged intestinal morphological structure, promoted intestinal C. perfringens growth and liver invasion, and enhanced anti-C. perfringens specific sIgA concentrations in the gut and specific IgG levels in serum compared with the uninfected birds. NE infection significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) decreased mucin-2 (at 14 d post-infection (DPI), toll -like receptor 2 (TLR2, at 7 and 14 DPI), TLR4 (at 7 and 14 DPI), tumor necrosis factor super family 15 (TNFSF15, at 7 and 14 DPI), lysozyme (LYZ, at 14 DPI) and fowlicidin-2 (at 7 and 14 DPI) mRNA levels, whereas it dramatically (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) increased IFN-γ mRNA levels at 7 DPI. However, challenged birds fed diets supplemented with B. coagulans showed a significant (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) decrease in gut lesion scores, decreased C. perfringens numbers in the cecum and liver, and an increase in fowlicidin-2 mRNA levels in compared with the uninfected birds. In addition, compared with the non-supplemented group, dietary inclusion of B. coagulans improved intestinal barrier structure, further increased specific sIgA levels and alkaline phosphatase (IAP) activity in the jejunum, enhanced the expression of jejunum lysozyme mRNA, and inhibited the growth, colonization, and invasion of C. perfringens; in contrast, it reduced serum-specific IgG concentrations and jejunum IFN-γ mRNA levels.ConclusionThese results indicated that dietary B. coagulans supplementation appeared to be effective in preventing the occurrence and reducing the severity of C. perfringens-induced NE in broiler chickens.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPolyamines stimulate DNA transcription and mRNA translation for protein synthesis in trophectoderm cells, as well as proliferation and migration of cells; therefore, they are essential for development and survival of conceptuses (embryo/fetus and placenta). The ovine conceptus produces polyamines via classical and non-classical pathways. In the classical pathway, arginine (Arg) is transformed into ornithine, which is then decarboxylated by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) to produce putrescine which is the substrate for the production of spermidine and spermine. In the non-classical pathway, Arg is converted to agmatine (Agm) by arginine decarboxylase (ADC), and Agm is converted to putrescine by agmatinase (AGMAT).MethodsMorpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MAOs) were designed and synthesized to inhibit translational initiation of the mRNAs for ODC1 and ADC, in ovine conceptuses.ResultsThe morphologies of MAO control, MAO-ODC1, and MAO-ADC conceptuses were normal. Double knockdown of ODC1 and ADC (MAO-ODC1:ADC) resulted in two phenotypes of conceptuses; 33% of conceptuses appeared to be morphologically and functionally normal (phenotype a) and 67% of the conceptuses presented an abnormal morphology and functionality (phenotype b). Furthermore, MAO-ODC1:ADC (a) conceptuses had greater tissue concentrations of Agm, putrescine, and spermidine than MAO control conceptuses, while MAO-ODC1:ADC (b) conceptuses only had greater tissue concentrations of Agm . Uterine flushes from ewes with MAO-ODC1:ADC (a) had greater amounts of arginine, aspartate, tyrosine, citrulline, lysine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, and glutamine, while uterine flushes of ewes with MAO-ODC1:ADC (b) conceptuses had lower amount of putrescine, spermidine, spermine, alanine, aspartate, glutamine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, and lysine.ConclusionsThe double-knockdown of translation of ODC1 and ADC mRNAs was most detrimental to conceptus development and their production of interferon tau (IFNT). Agm, polyamines, amino acids, and adequate secretion of IFNT are critical for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy during the peri-implantation period of gestation in sheep.',\n",

Betaine did not affect the protein content of ERα, but significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) increased hepatic expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at both mRNA and protein levels. Also, ERα/GR interaction tended to be enhanced in the liver nuclear lysates of betaine-supplemented hens as determined by co-immunoprecipitation.

Using six experiments in a step-wise design, we examined the effects of several culture conditions on the maintenance, proliferation, and colony formation of porcine gonocytes. Testis cells from neonatal piglets were cultured for 7 d in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The examined culture conditions included using different cell seeding densities, gonocyte proportions, incubation temperatures, sampling strategies, and medium changing regimens.ResultsConfluency of cells was optimal (>90% by ~6 d) when 3.0\\u2009×\\u2009104 testis cells/cm2 containing ~40% gonocytes were used. Incubating the cells at 35\\xa0°C or 37\\xa0°C resulted in similar cell number and viability at confluency, but incubation at 35\\xa0°C resulted in a delayed confluency. In the first 2 d of culture, gonocytes remained mostly floating in the medium and gradually settled over the next 5 d. Consequently, not changing the medium for 7 d (as opposed to changing it every 2 d) led to a significant increase in the number of gonocyte colonies by reducing the loss of “floating gonocytes”.ConclusionWe found that gonocytes require the presence of a critical minimum number of somatic cells for settlement, and can proliferate and form growing colonies even in a basic medium. Large numbers of viable gonocytes remain floating in the medium for several days. The optimized culture conditions in the present study included seeding with 3.0\\u2009×\\u2009104 testis cells/cm2 containing ~40% gonocytes, incubating at 37\\xa0°C, and without changing the medium in the first week, which can result in improved colony formation of porcine gonocytes.',\n",
       " 'The demand for duck meat, duck eggs, and associated products is increasing each year. Classic and modern selection programs have been applied to enhance the economic traits of ducks to satisfy the requirements of consumers and enhance the incomes of producers. The nutritional requirements of unselected ducks may not be adequate, however, to fulfill the potential productivity performance of modern birds, including both meat-type and egg-type ducks. In particular, an imbalanced diet is associated with low productive performance and signs of nutritional deficiency (if insufficient nutrients are supplied), as well as with high feed costs and manure problems that reflect flock health and welfare (if excessive nutrients are supplied). Thus, the main aim of this review is to summarize the results of previous studies that estimated the nutrient requirements of meat-type and egg-type ducks in order to evaluate current knowledge and to identify further issues that need to be addressed. In addition, the results obtained in previous studies are compared in order to understand how to lower commercial feed costs, fulfill the genetic potential of selected ducks, protect the environment from pollution, and satisfy the welfare and health needs of ducks.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPrevious research has revealed a strong inflammatory response within adipose (AT) tissue during the transition into lactation. Whether this effect is a result of oxidative stress induced by lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation associated with differences in prepartum body condition score remains to be determined. The objectives of this study were to investigate systemic biomarkers of energy balance and inflammation and the expression of lipid metabolism- and inflammation-related genes in AT during the transition period in dairy cows.ResultsTwenty multiparous Holstein cows were retrospectively divided by body condition score (BCS) prior to parturition into two groups (10 cows/group): BCS\\u2009≤\\u20093.25 (LoBCS) and BCS\\u2009≥\\u20093.75 (HiBCS). Subcutaneous adipose tissue was biopsied from the tail-head region at d\\u2009−\\u200910, 7 and 20 relative to parturition. Plasma was used to evaluate biomarkers of\\xa0energy balance (EBAL) [free fatty acids (NEFA), glycerol, insulin] and inflammation [IL-1β, haptoglobin, myeloperoxidase, and reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM)]. Although insulin concentration was not affected by BCS, NEFA was overall greater and glycerol lower in HiBCS cows. Greater activity of myeloperoxidase in plasma coincided with increased haptoglobin and IL-1β postpartum in LoBCS cows. Among genes related with oxidative stress, the expression of the cytosolic antioxidant enzyme SOD1 was greater in LoBCS compared to HiBCS. Cows in LoBCS compared with HiBCS had greater overall expression of ABDH5 and ATGL along with ADIPOQ, indicating enhanced basal lipolysis and secretion of adiponectin. Expression of CPT1A, ACADVL, and ACOX1 was greater overall in HiBCS than LoBCS indicating enhanced NEFA oxidation. Although the temporal increase in plasma NEFA regardless of BCS coincided with the profile of CPT1A, the gradual decrease in genes related with re-esterification of NEFA (PCK1) and glycerol efflux (AQP7) coupled with an increase in glycerol kinase (GK) suggested some stimulation of NEFA utilization within adipose tissue. This idea is supported in part by the gradual decrease in insulin regardless of BCS. Although expression of the inflammation-related gene toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was greater in HiBCS versus LoBCS cows at −10 d, expression of TLR9 was greater in HiBCS versus LoBCS at 20 d. These profiles did not seem to be associated with concentrations of\\xa0pro-inflammatory biomarkers or ROM.ConclusionsOverall, data indicated that cows with BCS 3.25 or lower before calving experienced greater alterations in systemic inflammation and basal lipolysis without excessive increases in NEFA plasma concentrations. Despite the greater plasma NEFA around parturition, cows with BCS 3.75 or higher seemed to have a more active system for catabolism of NEFA and utilization of glycerol within adipose tissue. A linkage between those pathways and risk of disorders postpartum remains to be determined.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe use of feed grade amino acids can reduce the cost of lactation feed. With changing genetics, increasing feed costs, and higher number of pigs weaned with heavier wean weights further evaluation of higher inclusion levels of feed-grade amino acid in lactation diets than previously published is warranted. Two experiments (Exp.) were conducted to determine the optimal inclusion level of L-lysine HCl to be included in swine lactation diets while digestible lysine levels remain constant across dietary treatments and allowing feed grade amino acids to be added to the diet to maintain dietary ratios relative to lysine to maximize litter growth rate and sow reproductive performance. Furthermore, the studies were to evaluate minimal amino acid ratios relative to lysine that allows for optimal litter growth rate and sow reproductive performance.ResultsExp. 1: Increasing L-lysine HCl resulted in similar gilt feed intake, litter, and reproductive performance. Average litter gain from birth to weaning was 2.51, 2.49, 2.59, 2.43, and 2.65\\xa0kg/d when gilts were fed 0.00, 0.075, 0.150, 0.225, and 0.30% L-lysine HCl, respectively. Exp. 2: The average litter gain from birth to weaning was 2.68, 2.73, 2.67, 2.70, and 2.64\\xa0kg/d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.70) when sows were fed 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.4% L-lysine HCl plus valine, respectively. No other differences among dietary treatments were observed.ConclusionsCollectively, these studies demonstrate corn-soybean meal based lactation diets formulated with a constant SID lysine content for all parities containing up to 0.40% L-lysine HCl with only supplemental feed grade threonine and a methionine source have no detrimental effect on litter growth rate and subsequent total born.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAssociative data and some controlled studies suggest that the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α can induce fatty liver in dairy cattle. However, research demonstrating that TNFα is a necessary component in the etiology of bovine fatty liver is lacking. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether blocking TNFα signaling with a synthetic cyclic peptide (TNF receptor loop peptide; TRLP) would improve liver metabolic function and reduce triglyceride accumulation during feed restriction.ResultsCapability of TRLP to inhibit TNFα signaling was confirmed on primary bovine hepatocytes treated with recombinant bovine TNFα and 4 doses of TRLP (0, 1, 10, 50\\xa0μmol/L) over 24\\xa0h. Next, 4 lactating Holstein cows (parity 1.4\\u2009±\\u20090.5, 433\\u2009±\\u2009131\\xa0d in milk) in an incomplete Latin rectangle design (3\\u2009×\\u20092) were subcutaneously administered with different TRLP doses (0, 1.5, 3.0\\xa0mg/kg BW) every 4\\xa0h for 24\\xa0h, followed by an intravenous injection of TNFα (5\\xa0μg/kg BW). Before and for 2\\xa0h after TNFα injection, TRLP decreased plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05), suggesting an altered metabolic response to inflammation. Finally, 10 non-pregnant, non-lactating Holstein cows (3.9\\u2009±\\u20091.1\\xa0yr of age) were randomly assigned to treatments: control (carrier: 57% DMSO in PBS) or TRLP (1.75\\xa0mg TRLP /kg BW per day). Treatments were administrated every 4\\xa0h for 7 d by subcutaneous injection to feed-restricted cows fed 30% of maintenance energy requirements. Daily blood samples were analyzed for glucose, insulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, NEFA, and haptoglobin concentrations, with no treatment effects detected. On d 7, cows completed a glucose tolerance test (GTT) by i.v. administration of a dextrose bolus (300\\xa0mg glucose/kg BW). Glucose, insulin, and NEFA responses failed to demonstrate any significant effect of treatment during the GTT. However, plasma and liver analyses were not indicative of dramatic lipolysis or hepatic lipidosis, suggesting that the feed restriction protocol failed to induce the metabolic state of interest. Injection site inflammation, assessed by a scorer blinded to treatment, was enhanced by TRLP compared to control.ConclusionsAlthough the TRLP inhibited bovine TNFα signaling and altered responses to i.v. administration of TNFα, repeated use over 7 d caused apparent local allergic responses and it failed to alter metabolism during a feed restriction-induced negative energy balance. Although responses to feed restriction seemed atypical in this study, side effects of TRLP argue against its future use as a tool for investigating the role of inflammation in metabolic impacts of negative energy balance.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPork produced by outdoor-reared pigs raised mostly on alfalfa pastures attracts increasing population of consumer from most of the world. In China, pigs were raised with alfalfa-containing diets to seek for good quality pork. However, the influence of dietary alfalfa involving high level of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) on pig intestinal luminal microbiota composition remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of alfalfa on luminal microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) production, and gene expressions involved in SCFA sensing, transporting and absorbing in pig caecal mucosa.ResultsTwenty-four growing pigs were randomly allotted to four diets containing 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% alfalfa meal for a 28-d experiment. Ingestion of alfalfa meal-contained diets significantly increased the ratio of body weight gain to feed consumption. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes showed that alfalfa-containing diet significantly decreased the relative abundance of genera Turicibacter, Acidiphilium, Paracoccus, Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Staphylococcus, and increased the relative abundance of genera Lachnospira, Marvinbryantia, and Desulfovibrio in the caecal digesta. Butyrate concentration was significantly increased in the hindgut by the supplementation of alfalfa meal in diets. The mRNA gene expressions of FFAR3, SMCT1, MCT1, PYY, and GCG were significantly increased in the caecal mucosa of pigs fed alfalfa meal.ConclusionsOur results suggested that alfalfa-containing diet has exerted significant impacts on caecal microbiota composition, butyrate concentration and significantly upregulated mRNA expression of host caecal mucosal genes involved in SCFA sensing and absorption as well as regulation of satiety.',\n",
       " 'Xylose, as β-1,4-linked xylan, makes up much of the hemicellulose in cell walls of cereal carbohydrates fed to pigs. As inclusion of fibrous ingredients in swine diets continues to increase, supplementation of carbohydrases, such as xylanase, is of interest. However, much progress is warranted to achieve consistent enzyme efficacy, including an improved understanding of the utilization and energetic contribution of xylanase hydrolysis product (i.e. xylooligosaccharides or monomeric xylose). This review examines reports on xylose absorption and metabolism in the pig and identifies gaps in this knowledge that are essential to understanding the value of carbohydrase hydrolysis products in the nutrition of the pig. Xylose research in pigs was first reported in 1954, with only sporadic contributions since. Therefore, this review also discusses relevant xylose research in other monogastric species, including humans. In both pigs and poultry, increasing purified D-xylose inclusion generally results in linear decreases in performance, efficiency, and diet digestibility. However, supplementation levels studied thus far have ranged from 5% to 40%, while theoretical xylose release due to xylanase supplementation would be less than 4%. More than 95% of ingested D-xylose disappears before the terminal ileum but mechanisms of absorption have yet to be fully elucidated. Some data support the hypothesis that mechanisms exist to handle low xylose concentrations but become overwhelmed as luminal concentrations increase. Very little is known about xylose metabolic utilization in vertebrates but it is well recognized that a large proportion of dietary xylose appears in the urine and significantly decreases the metabolizable energy available from the diet. Nevertheless, evidence of labeled D-xylose-1-14C appearing as expired 14CO2 in both humans and guinea pigs suggests that there is potential, although small, for xylose oxidation. It is yet to be determined if pigs develop increased xylose metabolic capacity with increased adaptation time to diets supplemented with xylose or xylanase. Overall, xylose appears to be poorly utilized by the pig, but it is important to consider that only one study has been reported which supplemented D-xylose dietary concentrations lower than 5%. Thus, more comprehensive studies testing xylose metabolic effects at dietary concentrations more relevant to swine nutrition are warranted.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundDairy cows can readily overconsume dietary energy during most of the prepartum period, often leading to higher prepartal concentrations of insulin and glucose and excessive body fat deposition. The end result of these physiologic changes is greater adipose tissue lipolysis post-partum coupled with excessive hepatic lipid accumulation and compromised health. Although transcriptional regulation of the adipose response to energy availability is well established in non-ruminants, such regulation in cow adipose tissue depots remains poorly characterized.ResultsEffects of ad-libitum access to high [HIGH; 1.62 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM)] or adequate (CON; 1.35 Mcal/kg of DM) dietary energy for 8 wk on mesenteric (MAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue transcript profiles were assessed in non-pregnant non-lactating Holstein dairy cows using a 13,000-sequence annotated bovine oligonucleotide microarray. Statistical analysis revealed 409 and 310 differentially expressed genes (DEG) due to tissue and diet. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA) with the KEGG pathway database. Compared with SAT, MAT had more active biological processes related to adipose tissue accumulation (adiponectin secretion) and signs of pro-inflammatory processes due to adipose tissue expansion and macrophage infiltration (generation of ceramides). Feeding the HIGH diet led to changes in mRNA expression of genes associated with cell hypertrophy (regucalcin), activation of adipogenesis (phospholipid phosphatase 1), insulin signaling activation (neuraminidase 1) and angiogenesis (semaphorin 4G, plexin B1). Further, inflammation due to HIGH was underscored by mRNA expression changes associated with oxidative stress response (coenzyme Q3, methyltransferase), ceramide synthesis (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1), and insulin signaling (interferon regulatory factor 1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1, retinoic acid receptor alpha). Activation of ribosome in cows fed HIGH indicated the existence of greater adipocyte growth rate (M-phase phosphoprotein 10, NMD3 ribosome export adaptor).ConclusionsThe data indicate that long-term ad-libitum access to a higher-energy diet led to transcriptional changes in adipose tissue that stimulated hypertrophy and the activity of pathways associated with a slight but chronic inflammatory response. Further studies would be helpful in determining the extent to which mRNA results also occur at the protein level.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe stomach is an underestimated key interface between the ingesta and the digestive system, affecting the digestion and playing an important role in several endocrine functions. The quality of starter microbiota and the early life feeding of medium chain triglycerides may affect porcine gastric maturation. Two trials (T1, T2) were carried out on 12 and 24 cesarean-delivered piglets (birth, d0), divided over two microbiota treatments, but slaughtered and sampled at two or three weeks of age, respectively. All piglets were fed orally: sow serum (T1) or pasteurized sow colostrum (T2) on d0; simple starter microbiota (Lactobacillus amylovorus, Clostridium glycolicum and Parabacteroides spp.) (d1-d3); complex microbiota inoculum (sow diluted feces, CA) or a placebo (simple association, SA) (d3-d4) and milk replacer ad libitum (d0-d4). The The T1 piglets and half of the T2 piglets were then fed a moist diet (CTRL); the remaining half of the T2 piglets were fed the CTRL diet fortified with medium chain triglycerides and 7% coconut oil (MCT). Total mRNA from the oxyntic mucosa was analyzed using Affymetrix©Porcine Gene array strips. Exploratory functional analysis of the resulting values was carried out using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.ResultsComplex microbiota upregulated 11 gene sets in piglets of each age group vs. SA. Of these sets, 6 were upregulated at both ages, including the set of gene markers of oxyntic mucosa. In comparison with the piglets receiving SA, the CA enriched the genes in the sets related to interferon response when the CTRL diet was given while the same sets were impoverished by CA with the MCT diet.ConclusionsEarly colonization with a complex starter microbiota promoted the functional maturation of the oxyntic mucosa in an age-dependent manner. The dietary fatty acid source may have affected the recruitment and the maturation of the immune cells, particularly when the piglets were early associated with a simplified starter microbiota.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe histone code is an established epigenetic regulator of early embryonic development in mammals. The lysine residue K9 of histone H3 (H3K9) is a prime target of SIRT1, a member of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase family of enzymes targeting both histone and non-histone substrates. At present, little is known about SIRT1-modulation of H3K9 in zygotic pronuclei and its association with the success of preimplantation embryo development. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of SIRT1 activity on H3K9 methylation and acetylation in porcine zygotes and the significance of H3K9 modifications for early embryonic development.ResultsOur results show that SIRT1 activators resveratrol and BML-278 increased H3K9 methylation and suppressed H3K9 acetylation in both the paternal and maternal pronucleus. Inversely, SIRT1 inhibitors nicotinamide and sirtinol suppressed methylation and increased acetylation of pronuclear H3K9. Evaluation of early embryonic development confirmed positive effect of selective SIRT1 activation on blastocyst formation rate (5.2\\xa0±\\xa02.9% versus 32.9\\xa0±\\xa08.1% in vehicle control and BML-278 group, respectively; P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). Stimulation of SIRT1 activity coincided with fluorometric signal intensity of ooplasmic ubiquitin ligase MDM2, a known substrate of SIRT1 and known limiting factor of epigenome remodeling.ConclusionsWe conclude that SIRT1 modulates zygotic histone code, obviously through direct deacetylation and via non-histone targets resulting in increased H3K9me3. These changes in zygotes lead to more successful pre-implantation embryonic development and, indeed, the specific SIRT1 activation due to BML-278 is beneficial for in vitro embryo production and blastocyst achievement.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundFeeding behavior study is important for animal husbandry and production. However, few studies were conducted on the feeding behavior and their relationship with feeding efficiency in Pekin ducks. In order to investigate the feeding behavior and their relationship with feed efficiency and other economic traits in Pekin ducks, we selected 358 male Pekin ducks and recorded feeding information between 3 to 6 wk of age using automatic electronic feeders, and compared the feeding behavior under different residual feed intake (RFI) levels.ResultsWe observed that total feed time, daily feed intake and feed intake per meal had strong positive correlations with feed efficiency traits; moreover, strong correlation between feed intake per meal and body weight was found (R=0.32, 0.36). Daily feeding rate meal and meal duration had weak correlations with feed efficiency (R=0.14~0.15). The phenotypic correlation of between-meal pauses, with feed efficiency was not observed. When daily changes were analyzed, high RFI ducks had the highest feed consumption over all times, and obvious differences in daily visits were found among different RFI level animals during the middle period; these differences were magnified with age, but there was no difference in daily meal number. Moreover, our data indicate that high RFI birds mainly take their meals at the edge of the population enclosure, where they are more susceptible to environmental interference.ConclusionsOverall, this study suggests that the general feeding behaviors can be accurately measured using automatic electronic feeders and certain feeding behaviors in Pekin ducks are associated with improved feed efficiency.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundDeoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species in the field, commonly found in cereal grains, which negatively affects performances and health of animals. Mycotoxin binders are supposed to reduce the toxicity of mycotoxins.MethodThe effect of a mycotoxin binder (containing acid-activated bentonite, clinoptilolite, yeast cell walls and organic acids) on growth performance and gut health was studied. Hundred and twenty weaning piglets were allocated to 4 treatments, with 5 pens of 6 piglets each, arranged in a 2\\xa0×\\xa02 factorial design: control diet; control diet with 1\\xa0kg/t binder; control diet with DON; and control diet with DON and 1\\xa0kg/t binder. From d0–14, the diet of DON-challenged groups was artificially contaminated with a mixture of DON (2.6\\xa0mg/kg), 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (0.1\\xa0mg/kg) and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (0.3\\xa0mg/kg), after which the total contamination level was reduced to 1\\xa0mg/kg, until d37. On d14, one pig from each pen was euthanized and distal small intestinal mucosa samples were collected for the assessment of intestinal permeability, and gene expression of tight junction proteins, toll-like receptor 4, inflammatory cytokines and intestinal alkaline phosphatase.ResultsAfter 37 d, there were no differences in growth performance between control and DON-challenged groups (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05). Nevertheless, groups that received diets with binder had a significantly higher average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) for the first 14 d as well as for the whole period, compared to groups without binder (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). Groups with binder in the diet also exhibited lower expression of toll-like receptor 4 in distal small intestinal mucosa at d14, compared to groups without binder (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). Interestingly, comparing the two DON treatments, piglets fed DON and binder had significantly higher ADFI and ADG compared to those with only DON for the first 14-d (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). Addition of binder to DON contaminated diets, also down-regulated the gene expression of toll-like receptor 4 (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05) and increased mRNA level zona occludens 1 (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.10) as compared to DON.ConclusionsThe present data provide evidence that the binder improves growth rate in piglets associated with reduction of toll-like receptor-4 and increase of tight junction protein gene expression. However, the current study does not allow to assess whether the effects of the binder are mediated by alterations in the toxicokinetics of the mycotoxin.',\n",

       " 'BackgroundFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a gonadotropin synthesized and secreted by the pituitary gland. FSH stimulates follicle development and maturation in females. It also plays an important role in spermatogenesis in males, including humans and mice. However, the effects of FSH on male pigs are largely unknown. In this study, we generated transgenic pigs to investigate the effects of FSHα/β overexpression on reproductive traits in boars.ResultsAfter five transgenic F0 founders were crossed with wide-type pigs, 193\\xa0F1 animals were obtained. Of these, 96 were confirmed as transgenic. FSHα and FSHβ mRNAs were detected only in pituitary tissue. Transgenic boars exhibited significantly higher levels of FSHα and FSHβ mRNA, serum FSH, and serum testosterone, compared to full-sib non-transgenic boars. Significant increases in testis weight, vas deferens diameter, seminiferous tubule diameter, and the number of Leydig cells were observed, suggesting that the exogenous FSHα/β affects reproductive traits. Finally, transgenic and non-transgenic boars had similar growth performance and biochemical profiles.ConclusionsPituitary-specific overexpression of FSHα/β genes is likely to impact reproductive traits positively, as indicated by enhancements in serum testosterone level, testis weight, the development of vas deferens, seminiferous tubules, and Leydig cells in transgenic boars. A high level of serum FSH induces secretion of serum testosterone, possibly by boosting the number of Leydig cells, which presumably increases the libido and the frequency of sexual activity in transgenic boars. Our study provides a preliminary foundation for the genetic improvement of reproductive traits in male pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundInterleukin-1β (IL-1β) is important mediator of inflammatory-induced suppression of reproductive axis at the hypothalamic level. At the beginning of inflammation, the main source of cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is peripheral circulation, while over time, cytokines produced in the brain are more important. Melatonin has been shown to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines concentration in the brain. In ewes, melatonin is used to advance the onset of a breading season. Little is known about CSF concentration of IL-1β in ewes and its correlation with plasma during inflammation as well as melatonin action on the concentration of IL-1β in blood plasma and the CSF, and brain barriers permeability in early stage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation.MethodsSystemic inflammation was induced through LPS administration in melatonin- and sham-implanted ewes. Blood and CSF samples were collected before and after LPS administration and IL-1β and albumin concentration were measured. To assess the functions of brain barriers albumin quotient (QAlb) was used. Expression of IL-1β (Il1B) and its receptor type I (Il1r1) and type II (Il1r2) and matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp) 3 and 9 was evaluated in the choroid plexus (CP).ResultsBefore LPS administration, IL-1β was on the level of 62.0\\xa0±\\xa029.7\\xa0pg/mL and 66.4\\xa0±\\xa032.1\\xa0pg/mL in plasma and 26.2\\xa0±\\xa05.4\\xa0pg/mL and 21.3\\xa0±\\xa08.7\\xa0pg/mL in the CSF in sham- and melatonin-implanted group, respectively.

No correlations was found between plasma and CSF IL-1β concentration after LPS in both groups. The QAlb calculated before LPS and 6\\xa0h after was similar in all groups. Melatonin did not affected mRNA expression of Il1B, Il1r1 and Il1r2 in the CP. The mRNA expression of Mmp3 and Mmp9 was not detected.ConclusionsThe lack of correlation between plasma and CSF IL-1β concentration indicates that at the beginning of inflammation the local synthesis of IL-1β in the CP is an important source of IL-1β in the CSF. Melatonin from slow-release implants does not affect IL-1β concentration in plasma and CSF in early stage of systemic inflammation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIt is well known that feeding a high concentrate (HC) diet to lactating ruminants likely induces subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) and leads to a decrease in milk fat production. However, the effects of feeding a HC diet for long periods on milk fatty acids composition and the mechanism behind the decline of milk fat still remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of feeding a HC diet to lactating dairy goats on milk fat yield and fatty acids composition with an emphasis on the mechanisms underlying the milk fat depression. Seventeen mid-lactating dairy goats were randomly allocated to three groups. The control treatment was fed a low-concentrate diet (35% concentrate, n\\xa0=\\xa05, LC) and there were two high-concentrate treatments (65% concentrate, HC), one fed a high concentrate diet for a long period (19 wks, n\\xa0=\\xa07, HL); one fed a high concentrate diet for a short period of time (4 wk, n\\xa0=\\xa05, HS). Milk fat production and fatty acids profiles were measured. In order to investigate the mechanisms underlying the changes in milk fat production and composition, the gene expression involved in lipid metabolism and DNA methylation in the mammary gland were also analyzed.ResultsMilk production was increased by feeding the HC diet in the HS and HL groups compared with the LC diet (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), while the percentage of milk fat was lower in the HL (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) but not in the HS group. The total amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in the milk was not changed by feeding the HC diet, whereas the levels of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were markedly decreased in the HL group compared with the LC group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Among these fatty acids, the concentrations of C15:0 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), C17:0 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), C17:1 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01), C18:1n-9c (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), C18:3n-3r (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) and C20:0 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) were markedly lower in the HL group, and the concentrations of C20:0 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and C18:3n-3r (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01) were lower in the HS group compared with the LC group. However, the concentrations of C18:2n-6c (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and C20:4n-6 (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the milk fat were higher in the HS group. Real-time PCR results showed that the mRNA expression of the genes involved in milk fat production in the mammary gland was generally decreased in the HL and HS groups compared with the LC group. Among these genes, ACSL1, ACSS1 & 2, ACACA, FAS, SCD, FADS2, and SREBP1 were down-regulated in the mammary gland of the HL group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), and the expressions of ACSS2, ACACA, and FADS2 mRNA were markedly decreased in the HS goats compared with the LC group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). In contrast to the gene expression, the level of DNA methylation in the promoter regions of the ACACA and SCD genes was increased in the HL group compared with the LC group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). The levels of ACSL1 protein expression and FAS enzyme activity were also decreased in the mammary gland of the HL compared with the LC group (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).ConclusionsLong-term feeding of a HC diet to lactating goats induced milk fat depression and FAs profile shift with lower MUFAs but higher SFAs. A general down-regulation of the gene expression involved in the milk fat production and a higher DNA methylation in the mammary gland may contribute to the decrease in milk fat production in goats fed a HC diet for long time periods.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundNutrition is one of the most important factors that affect animal performance, and it therefore also impacts on financial results in beef systems. In this way, finding the best strategy for feeding supplements is of paramount importance. Aiming to evaluate the effect of supplement feeding strategies for beef cows in the last third of gestation, two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, 35 pregnant Nellore cows were assigned to a completely randomized design with four treatments: control, which received no supplement; supplementation for the last 30\\xa0d of gestation (30-d; 3.0\\xa0kg/d); supplementation for the last 60\\xa0d of gestation (60-d; 1.5\\xa0kg/d); or supplementation for the last 90\\xa0d of gestation (90-d; 1.0\\xa0kg/d). All supplemented treatments received the same total amount of supplement throughout the experiment: 90\\xa0kg (20% of crude protein). A second experiment (Experiment 2) was delineated to evaluate the effects of the amounts offered in Experiment 1 on intake and metabolism. Four multiparous pregnant Nellore cows were assigned to a 4\\xa0×\\xa04 Latin square design, with periods of 15\\xa0d each.ResultsThere was a linear effect of the number of days of supplementation on calving body weight (BW; P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and a quadratic effect on BW change from parturition to d 31 post-calving (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), with cows on the 60-d strategy losing less BW post-calving. No difference was found in offspring birth BW (P\\xa0>\\xa00.10). A significant linear effect on interval from parturition to conception (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) was observed, with the highest calving to conception interval being observed in the 90-d strategy. The level of supplementation did not affect forage intake or neutral detergent fiber digestibility (P\\xa0>\\xa00.10). Nitrogen excreted through urine tended to increase linearly with the level of supplementation (P\\xa0<\\xa00.10).ConclusionProviding 1.5\\xa0kg of supplement during the last 60\\xa0d of gestation improves cow performance after calving, reducing the magnitude of BW lost, and reduces the number of days from calving to re-conception in the following breeding season compared to the usually recommended period of supplementation of 90\\xa0d pre-partum.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe lipid from egg yolk is largely consumed in supplying the energy for embryonic growth until hatching. The remaining lipid in the yolk sac is transported into the hatchling’s tissues. The gene expression profiles of fast- and slow-growing chickens, Arbor Acres (AA) and Beijing-You (BJY), were determined to identify global differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways related to lipid metabolism in the pectoralis major at hatching.ResultsBetween these two breeds, the absolute and weight-specific amounts of total yolk energy (TYE) and intramuscular fat (IMF) content in pectoralis major of fast-growing chickens were significantly higher (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01, P\\xa0<\\xa00.05, respectively) than those of the slow-growing breed. IMF content and u-TYE were significantly related (r\\xa0=\\xa00.9047, P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). Microarray analysis revealed that gene transcripts related to lipogenesis, including PPARG, RBP7, LPL, FABP4, THRSP, ACACA, ACSS1, DGAT2, and GK, were significantly more abundant in breast muscle of fast-growing chickens than in slow-growing chickens. Conversely, the abundance of transcripts of genes involved in fatty acid degradation and glycometabolism, including ACAT1, ACOX2, ACOX3, CPT1A, CPT2, DAK, APOO, FUT9, GCNT1, and B4GALT3, was significantly lower in fast-growing chickens. The results further indicated that the PPAR signaling pathway was directly involved in fat deposition in pectoralis major, and other upstream pathways (Hedgehog, TGF-beta, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways) play roles in its regulation of the expression of related genes.ConclusionsAdditional energy from the yolk sac is transported and deposited as IMF in the pectoralis major of chickens at hatching. Genes and pathways related to lipid metabolism (such as PPAR, Hedgehog, TGF-beta, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways) promote the deposition of IMF in the pectoralis major of fast-growing chickens compared with those that grow more slowly. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism and deposition in hatchling chickens.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe aim of this study was to estimate variance components and to identify genomic regions and pathways associated with resistance to gastrointestinal parasites, particularly Haemonchus contortus, in a breed of sheep adapted to tropical climate. Phenotypes evaluations were performed to verify resistance to gastrointestinal parasites, and were divided into two categories: i) farm phenotypes, assessing body condition score (BCS), degree of anemia assessed by the famacha chart (FAM), fur score (FS) and feces consistency (FC); and ii) lab phenotypes, comprising blood analyses for hematocrit (HCT), white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelets (PLT) and transformed (log10) egg per gram of feces (EPGlog). A total of 576 animals were genotyped with the Ovine SNP12k BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.), that contains 12,785 bialleleic SNP markers. The variance components were estimated using a single trait model by single step genomic BLUP procedure.ResultsThe overall linkage disequilibrium (LD) mean between pairs of markers measured by r2 was 0.23. The overall LD mean between markers considering windows up to 10\\xa0Mb was 0.07. The mean LD between adjacent SNPs across autosomes ranged from 0.02 to 0.10. Heritability estimates were low for EPGlog (0.11), moderate for RBC (0.18), PLT (0.17) HCT (0.20), HGB (0.16) and WBC (0.22), and high for FAM (0.35). A total of 22, 21, 23, 20, 26, 25 and 23 windows for EPGlog for FAM, WBC, RBC, PLT, HCT and HGB traits were identified, respectively. Among the associated windows, 10 were shown to be common to HCT and HGB traits on OAR1, OAR2, OAR3, OAR5, OAR8 and OAR15.ConclusionThe traits indicating gastrointestinal parasites resistance presented an adequate genetic variability to respond to selection in Santa Inês breed, and it is expected a higher genetic gain for FAM trait when compared to the others. The level of LD estimated for markers separated by less than 1\\xa0Mb indicated that the Ovine SNP12k BeadChip might be a suitable tool for identifying genomic regions associated with traits related to gastrointestinal parasite resistance. Several candidate genes related to immune system development and activation, inflammatory response, regulation of lymphocytes and leukocytes proliferation were found. These genes may help in the selection of animals with higher resistance to parasites.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAn oviduct- specific glycoprotein, OVGP1, is synthesized and secreted by non-ciliated epithelial cells of the mammalian oviduct which provides an essential milieu for reproductive functions. The present study reports the effects of recombinant buffalo OVGP1 that lacks post-translational modifications, and native Buffalo OVGP1 isolated from oviductal tissue, on frozen- thawed sperm functions and in vitro embryo development.ResultsThe proportion of viable sperms was greater (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the recombinant OVGP1-treated group compared to the native OVGP1-treated group at 2\\xa0h, 3\\xa0h, and 4\\xa0h of incubation. The proportion of motile sperms at 3\\xa0h and 4\\xa0h of incubation; and membrane- intact sperms at 4\\xa0h was greater (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the native OVGP1-treated group compared to the control and recombinant OVGP1-treated groups. The proportion of capacitated and acrosome- reacted sperms was greater (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the native OVGP1-treated group compared to the recombinant OVGP1 group at 4\\xa0h. The rates of cleavage of embryos and their development to the blastocyst stage were greater (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the presence of either native or recombinant OVGP1 in comparison to control at 10\\xa0μg/mL concentration as compared to 5 or 20\\xa0μg/mL.ConclusionsThe study suggests that both native and recombinant OVGP1 impart a positive effect on various sperm features and in vitro embryo development. However, native OVGP1 was found to have a more pronounced effect in comparison to recombinant non-glycosylated OVGP1 on various sperm functions except viability. Hence, our current findings infer that glycosylation of OVGP1 might be essential in sustaining the sperm functions but not the in vitro embryo development.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe broiler industry has undergone intense genetic selection over the past 50\\xa0yr. resulting in improvements for growth and feed efficiency, however, significant variation remains for performance and growth traits. Production improvements have been coupled with unfavourable metabolic consequences, including immunological trade-offs for growth, and excess fat deposition. To determine whether interactions between fatty acid (FA) metabolism and innate immunity may be associated with performance variations commonly seen within commercial broiler flocks, total carcass lipid %, carcass and blood FA composition, as well as genes involved with FA metabolism, immunity and cellular stress were investigated in male birds of a broiler strain, layer strain and F1 layer × broiler cross at d 14 post hatch. Heterophil: lymphocyte ratios, relative organ weights and bodyweight data were also compared.ResultsBroiler bodyweight (n\\xa0=\\xa012) was four times that of layers (n\\xa0=\\xa012) by d 14 and had significantly higher carcass fat percentage compared to the cross (n\\xa0=\\xa06; P\\xa0=\\xa00.002) and layers (P\\xa0=\\xa00.017) which were not significantly different from each other (P\\xa0=\\xa00.523). The carcass and whole blood FA analysis revealed differences in the FA composition between the three groups indicating altered FA metabolism, despite all being raised on the same diet. Genes associated with FA synthesis and β-oxidation were upregulated in the broilers compared to the layers indicating a net overall increase in FA metabolism, which may be driven by the larger relative liver size as a percentage of bodyweight in the broilers. Genes involved in innate immunity such as TLR2 and TLR4, as well as organelle stress indicators ERN1 and XBP1 were found to be non-significant, with the exception of high expression levels of XBP1 in layers compared to the cross and broilers. Additionally there was no difference in heterophil: lymphocytes between any of the birds.ConclusionsThe results provide evidence that genetic selection may be associated with altered metabolic processes between broilers, layers and their F1 cross. Whilst there is no evidence of interactions between FA metabolism, innate immunity or cellular stress, further investigations at later time points as growth and fat deposition increase would provide useful information as to the effects of divergent selection on key metabolic and immunological processes.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundBetaine affects fat metabolism in animals, but the specific mechanism is still not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate possible mechanisms of betaine in altering lipid metabolism in muscle tissue in finishing pigs.MethodsA total of 120 crossbred gilts (Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc) with an average initial body weight of 70.1\\xa0kg were randomly allotted to three dietary treatments. The treatments included a corn–soybean meal basal diet supplemented with 0, 1250 or 2500\\xa0mg/kg betaine. The feeding experiment lasted 42\\xa0d.ResultsBetaine addition to the diet significantly increased the concentration of free fatty acids (FFA) in muscle (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Furthermore, the levels of serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were decreased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and total cholesterol content was increased in muscle (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) of betaine fed pigs. Experiments on genes involved in fatty acid transport showed that betaine increased expression of lipoprotein lipase(LPL), fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation (FAT/CD36), fatty acid binding protein (FABP3) and fatty acid transport protein (FATP1) (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). The abundance of fatty acid transport protein and fatty acid binding protein were also increased by betaine (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). As for the key factors involved in fatty acid oxidation, although betaine supplementation didn’t affect the level of carnitine and malonyl-CoA, betaine increased mRNA and protein abundance of carnitine palmitransferase-1(CPT1) and phosphorylated-AMPK (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).ConclusionsThe results suggested that betaine may promoted muscle fatty acid uptake via up-regulating the genes related to fatty acid transporter including FAT/CD36, FATP1 and FABP3. On the other hand, betaine activated AMPK and up-regulated genes related to fatty acid oxidation including PPARα and CPT1. The underlying mechanism regulating fatty acid metabolism in pigs supplemented with betaine is associated with the up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid transport and fatty acid oxidation.',\n",
       " 'The concept of foetal programming (FP) originated from human epidemiological studies, where foetal life nutrition was linked to health and disease status later in life. Since the proposal of this phenomenon, it has been evaluated in various animal models to gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying the foetal origins of health and disease in humans. In FP research, the sheep has been quite extensively used as a model for humans. In this paper we will review findings mainly from our Copenhagen sheep model, on the implications of late gestation malnutrition for growth, development, and metabolic and endocrine functions later in life, and discuss how these implications may depend on the diet fed to the animal in early postnatal life. Our results have indicated that negative implications of foetal malnutrition, both as a result of overnutrition and, particularly, late gestation undernutrition, can impair a wide range of endocrine functions regulating growth and presumably also reproductive traits. These implications are not readily observable early in postnatal life, but are increasingly manifested as the animal approaches adulthood. No intervention or cure is known that can reverse this programming in postnatal life. Our findings suggest that close to normal growth and slaughter results can be obtained at least until puberty in animals which have undergone adverse programming in foetal life, but manifestation of programming effects becomes increasingly evident in adult animals. Due to the risk of transfer of the adverse programming effects to future generations, it is therefore recommended that animals that are suspected to have undergone adverse FP are not used for reproduction. Unfortunately, no reliable biomarkers have as yet been identified that allow accurate identification of adversely programmed offspring at birth, except for very low or high birth weights, and, in pigs, characteristic changes in head shape (dolphin head). Future efforts should be therefore dedicated to identify reliable biomarkers and evaluate their effectiveness for alleviation/reversal of the adverse programming in postnatal life. Our sheep studies have shown that the adverse impacts of an extreme, high-fat diet in early postnatal life, but not prenatal undernutrition, can be largely reversed by dietary correction later in life. Thus, birth (at term) appears to be a critical set point for permanent programming in animals born precocial, such as sheep. Appropriate attention to the nutrition of the late pregnant dam should therefore be a priority in animal production systems.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundDuring late gestation the placental epithelial interface becomes highly folded, which involves changes in stromal hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is composed of glucoronate and N-acetyl-glucosamine. We hypothesized that supplementing gestating dams with glucosamine during this time would support placental folded-epithelial-bilayer development and increase litter size. In Exp. 1, gilts were unilaterally hysterectomized-ovariectomized (UHO). UHO gilts were mated and then supplemented daily with 10\\xa0g glucosamine (n\\xa0=\\xa016) or glucose (control, n\\xa0=\\xa017) from d 85 of gestation until slaughter (d 105). At slaughter, the number of live fetuses was recorded and each live fetus and its placenta was weighed. Uterine wall samples adjacent to the largest and smallest fetuses within each litter were processed for histology. In Exp. 2, pregnant sows in a commercial sow farm were supplemented with either 10\\xa0g glucosamine or glucose daily from d 85 of gestation to farrowing. Total piglets born and born alive were recorded for each litter. In Exp. 3, the same commercial farm and same protocol were used except that the dose of glucosamine and glucose was doubled to 20\\xa0g/d.ResultsIn Exp. 1, the number of live fetuses tended to be greater in glucosamine-treated UHO gilts (P\\xa0=\\xa00.098). Placental morphometry indicated that the width of the folded bilayer was greater (P\\xa0=\\xa00.05) in glucosamine-treated gilts. In Exp. 2, litter size did not differ between glucosamine- and glucose-treated sows. However in Exp. 3, the increased dose of glucosamine resulted in a significant treatment by parity interaction (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01), in which total piglets born and born alive were greater in glucosamine treated sows of later parity (5 and 6).ConclusionsThese results indicated that glucosamine supplementation increased the width of the folds of the placental bilayer and increased litter size in later parity, intact pregnant commercial sows.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundLeptin has a strong relation to important traits in animal production, such as carcass composition, feed intake, and reproduction. It is mainly produced by adipose cells and acts predominantly in the hypothalamus. In this study, circulating leptin and its gene expression in muscle were evaluated in two groups of young Nellore bulls with divergent feed efficiency. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) and average daily gain (ADG) of 98 Nellore bulls were evaluated in feedlot for 70 d to determinate the residual feed intake (RFI) and select 20 animals for the high feed efficient (LRFI) and 20 for the low feed efficient (HRFI) groups. Blood samples were collected on d 56 and at slaughter (80 d) to determine circulating plasma leptin. Samples of Longissimus dorsi were taken at slaughter for leptin gene expression levels.ResultsDMI and RFI were different between groups and LRFI animals showed less back fat and rump fat thickness, as well as less pelvic and kidney fat weight. Circulating leptin increased over time in all animals. Plasma leptin was greater in LRFI on 56 d and at slaughter (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0049). Gene expression of leptin were greater in LRFI animals (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0022) in accordance with the plasma levels. The animals of the LRFI group were leaner, ate less, and had more circulating leptin and its gene expression.ConclusionThese findings demonstrated that leptin plays its physiological role in young Nellore bulls, probably controlling food intake because feed efficient animals have more leptin and lower residual feed intake.',\n",

Data quality control was conducted resulting in 672,778 SNPs and 392 animals.ResultsAssociated SNPs were observed for scrotal circumference at 420\\xa0d of age (435 SNPs), followed by scrotal circumference at 210\\xa0d of age (12 SNPs), age at first calving (six SNPs), and age at second calving (four SNPs). We investigated whether significant SNPs were within genic or surrounding regions. Biological processes of genes were associated with immune system, multicellular organismal process, response to stimulus, apoptotic process, cellular component organization or biogenesis, biological adhesion, and reproduction.ConclusionsFew associations were observed for scrotal circumference at 210\\xa0d of age, age at first calving, and age at second calving, reinforcing their polygenic inheritance and the complexity of understanding the genetic architecture of reproductive traits. Finding many associations for scrotal circumference at 420\\xa0d of age in various regions of the Canchim genome also reveals the difficulty of targeting specific candidate genes that could act on fertility; nonetheless, the high linkage disequilibrium between loci herein estimated could aid to overcome this issue. Therefore, all relevant information about genomic regions influencing reproductive traits may contribute to target candidate genes for further investigation of causal mutations and aid in future genomic studies in Canchim cattle to improve the breeding program.',\n",

       " 'BackgroundWhen an animal is exposed to a stressor, metabolic rate, energy consumption and utilisation increase primarily through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Changes to partitioning of energy by an animal are likely to influence the efficiency with which it is utilised. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the physiological stress response to an exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge in beef heifers divergently ranked on phenotypic residual feed intake (RFI).ResultsData were collected on 34 Simmental weaning beef heifers the progeny of a well characterized and divergently bred RFI suckler beef herd. Residual feed intake was determined on each animal during the post-weaning stage over a 91-day feed intake measurement period during which they were individually offered adlibitum grass silage and 2\\xa0kg of concentrate per head once daily. The 12 highest [0.34\\xa0kg DM/d] and 12 lowest [−0.48\\xa0kg DM/d] ranking animals on RFI were selected for use in this study. For the physiological stress challenge heifers (mean age 605\\xa0±\\xa013 d; mean BW 518\\xa0±\\xa031.4\\xa0kg) were fitted aseptically with indwelling jugular catheters to facilitate intensive blood collection. The response of the adrenal cortex to a standardised dose of ACTH (1.98\\xa0IU/kg metabolic BW0.75) was examined. Serial blood samples were analysed for plasma cortisol, ACTH and haematology variables. Heifers differing in RFI did not differ (P\\xa0=\\xa00.59) in ACTH concentrations. Concentration of ACTH peaked (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) in both RFI groups at 20\\xa0min post-ACTH administration, following which concentration declined to baseline levels by 150\\xa0min. Similarly, cortisol systemic profile peaked at 60\\xa0min and concentrations remained continuously elevated for 150\\xa0min. A RFI\\xa0×\\xa0time interaction was detected for cortisol concentrations (P\\xa0=\\xa00.06) with high RFI heifers had a greater cortisol response than Low RFI from 40\\xa0min to 150\\xa0min relative to ACTH administration. Cortisol response was positively associated with RFI status (r\\xa0=\\xa00.32; P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). No effect of RFI was evident for neutrophil, lymphocytes, monocyte, eosinophils and basophil count. Plasma red blood cell number (6.07 vs. 6.23; P\\xa0=\\xa00.02) and hematocrit percentage (23.2 vs. 24.5; P\\xa0=\\xa00.02) were greater for low than high RFI animals.ConclusionsEvidence is provided that feed efficiency is associated with HPA axis function and susceptibility to stress, and responsiveness of the HPA axis is likely to contribute to appreciable variation in the efficiency feed utilisation of cattle.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of overfeeding a moderate energy diet and a 2,4-thiazolidinedione (TZD) injection on blood and hepatic tissue biomarkers of lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation as it relates to insulin sensitivity.ResultsFourteen dry non-pregnant cows were fed a control (CON) diet to meet 100% of NRC requirements for 3\\xa0wk, after which half of the cows were assigned to a moderate-energy diet (OVE) and half of the cows continued on CON for 6\\xa0wk. All cows received an intravenous injection of 4\\xa0mg TZD/kg of body weight (BW) daily from 2\\xa0wk after initiation of dietary treatments and for 2 additional week. Compared with CON cows and before TZD treatment, the OVE cows had lower concentration of total protein, urea and albumin over time. The concentration of cholesterol and tocopherol was greater after 2\\xa0wk of TZD regardless of diet. Before and after TZD, the OVE cows had greater concentrations of AST/GOT, while concentrations of paraoxonase, total protein, globulin, myeloperoxidase, and haptoglobin were lower compared with CON cows. Regardless of diet, TZD administration increased the concentration of ceruloplasmin, ROMt, cholesterol, tocopherol, total protein, globulin, myeloperoxidase and beta-carotene. In contrast, the concentration of haptoglobin decreased at the end of TZD injection regardless of diet. Prior to TZD injection, the mRNA expression of PC, ANGPTL4, FGF21, INSR, ACOX1, and PPARD in liver of\\xa0OVE cows was lower compared with CON cows. In contrast, the expression of HMGCS2 was greater in OVE compared with CON cows. After 1\\xa0wk of TZD administration the expression of IRS1 decreased regardless of diet; whereas, expression of INSR increased after 2\\xa0wk of TZD injection. Cows fed OVE had lower overall expression of TNF, INSR, PC, ACOX1, FGF21, and PPARD but greater HMGCS2 expression. These differences were most evident before and after 1\\xa0wk of TZD injection, and by 2\\xa0wk of TZD differences in expression for most genes disappeared.ConclusionsBased on molecular and blood data, administration of TZD enhanced some aspects of insulin sensitivity while causing contradictory results in terms of inflammation and oxidative stress. The bovine liver is TZD-responsive and level of dietary energy can modify the effects of TZD. Because insulin sensitizers have been proposed as useful tools to manage dairy cows during the transition period, further studies are required to investigate the potential hepatotoxicity effect of TZD (or similar compounds) in dairy cattle.',\n",

The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary methionine on growth performance, digestive and absorptive ability, as well as antioxidant capacity in the intestine and hepatopancreas of sub-adult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).ResultsDietary methionine deficiency significantly decreased percentage weight gain (PWG), feed intake, feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio, as well as activities of hepatopancreatic glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and muscle glutamate-pyruvate transaminase in sub-adult grass carp (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Furthermore, methionine deficiency significantly reduced activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase in the intestine, Na+/K+-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase in three intestinal segments, and creatine kinase (CK) in the proximal intestine (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). However, an unexplained and significant increase in CK activity in the mid intestine was associated with dietary methionine deficiency. Malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in the intestine and hepatopancreas were significantly increased by methionine deficiency (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), whereas anti-hydroxyl radical capacity in the hepatopancreas and intestine, and anti-superoxide anion capacity in the intestine, were significantly decreased by methionine deficiency (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). Moreover, methionine deficiency significantly decreased superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activities, glutathione contents in the hepatopancreas and intestine, as well as glutathione peroxidase activity in the intestine (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), whereas it significantly increased activities of catalase in the hepatopancreas and glutathione-S-transferase in the hepatopancreas and intestine (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05).ConclusionsThe present results demonstrated that dietary methionine deficiency induced poor growth, and decreased digestive and absorptive function and antioxidant capacity in the hepatopancreas and intestine of sub-adult grass carp. Methionine requirements for sub-adult grass carp (450-1, 170\\xa0g) based on PWG, intestinal trypsin, and hepatopancreatic anti-hydroxyl radical activities were estimated to be 6.12\\xa0g/kg diet (21.80\\xa0g/kg protein), 6.99\\xa0g/kg diet (24.90\\xa0g/kg protein) and 5.42\\xa0g/kg diet (19.31\\xa0g/kg protein), respectively, in the presence of 1.50\\xa0g cysteine/kg (5.35\\xa0g/kg protein).',\n",
       " 'BackgroudThis study aimed to determine the effects of early antibiotic intervention (EAI) on subsequent blood parameters, apparent nutrient digestibility, and fecal fermentation profile in pigs with different dietary crude protein (CP) levels. Eighteen litters of piglets (total 212) were randomly allocated to 2 groups and were fed a creep feed diet with or without in-feed antibiotics (olaquindox, oxytetracycline calcium and kitasamycin) from postnatal d 7 to d 42. On d 42, the piglets within the control or antibiotic group were mixed, respectively, and then further randomly assigned to a normal- (20%, 18%, and 14% CP from d 42 to d 77, d 77 to d 120, and d 120 to d 185, respectively) or a low-CP diet (16%, 14%, and 10% CP from d 42 to d 77, d 77 to d 120, and d 120 to d 185, respectively), generating 4 groups. On d 77 (short-term) and d 185 (long-term), serum and fecal samples were obtained for blood parameters, microbial composition and microbial metabolism analysis.ResultsEAI increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) albumin and glucose concentrations in low-CP diet on d 77, and increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) urea concentration in normal-CP diet. On d 185, EAI increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) globulin concentration in normal-CP diets, but decreased glucose concentration. For nutrient digestibility, EAI increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) digestibility of CP on d 77. For fecal microbiota, the EAI as well as low-CP diet decreased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) E. coli count on d 77. For fecal metabolites, on d 77, EAI decreased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) total amines concentration but increased skatole concentration in low-CP diet. On d 185, the EAI increased (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) putrescine and total amines concentrations in low-CP diets but reduced (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) in the normal-CP diets. The low-CP diet decreased the concentrations of these compounds.ConclusionsCollectively, these results indicate that EAI has short-term effects on the blood parameters and fecal microbial fermentation profile. The effects of EAI varied between CP levels, which was characterized by the significant alteration of glucose and putrescine concentration.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundMaternal obesity alters oocytes and subsequent fetal metabolism. An increasing number of studies have shown that the endoplasmic reticulums (ER) or mitochondria have important effects on oocyte quality, but there has been no study of the effect of mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) on oocyte quality. The present study was designed to assess whether the level of MAM and MAM-related proteins were different in oocytes from obese and control mice.ResultsFirst, oocytes from mice with high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity had higher levels (either greater numbers or a higher proportion for the same numbers) of MAM than oocytes from control mice. The abundance of MAM-related proteins in oocytes from obese mice was significantly greater at both the messenger RNA and protein levels, including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 1 (IP3R1), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 2 (IP3R2) and phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2). Further, there was an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) which was associated with increased apoptosis and compromised cytoplasmic maturation in oocytes from obese mice. Down-regulation of MAM-related protein IP3R1 in oocytes from obese mice decreased [Ca2+]m and apoptosis and improved cytoplasmic maturation but did not reduce the overall MAM level. However, down-regulating MAM-related protein PACS-2 in oocytes from obese mice did reduce the level of MAM and [Ca2+]m, which decreased the rate of apoptosis and improved cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes from obese mice.ConclusionsIt is possible that enriched MAM could increase [Ca2+]m, and this increase has been found to be associated with increased apoptosis and compromised cytoplasmic maturation in oocytes from obese mice. This finding suggests a novel therapeutic target for obesity-induced oocyte defects.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundApplication the innovative method which is in ovo technology provides a means of modulating the immune system at early embryonic stages. The aim of study was to determine influence of the in ovo stimulation, on d 12 of incubation, with synbiotics (synbiotic 1- L. salivarius IBB3154\\xa0+\\xa0Bi2tos, Clasado Ltd. and the synbiotic 2 - L. plantarum IBB3036\\xa0+\\xa0lupin RFOs) on the microstructure of duodenum, jejunum and ileum in the 1st and 42nd day of rearing.ResultsOn the 1st day of chickens life, in the duodenum of both experimental groups (SYN1 and SYN2), a significantly higher and wider intestinal villi as well as a significantly larger absorbent surface of these villi were found in comparison with the Control group (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01). On the 42nd day of rearing the beneficial effect of synbiotic 1 was reflected by the numerically higher villi (no statistical differences) with a larger surface (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01) in the duodenum in the SYN1 group compare to the Control group. In the jejunum on the 1st day of life, in the SYN1 group, significantly higher villi than in the Control group, with a simultaneous decrease in the depth of crypts (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01), and also the largest width of villi and their absorbent area (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01) in comparison to the other groups were found. On the 42nd day of life, in the jejunum, an increase in the height of the villi whilst reducing the crypt depth in the SYN2 group was found (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01). In turn, in the SYN1 group, there were significantly more neutral goblet cells observed compared with the control group (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05). In the ileum of 1-day-old chickens, the widest villi (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05) and the deepest crypts (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.01) were found in the SYN2 group. In the same group, there was also the least amount of neutral goblet cells in comparison to the other groups (P\\xa0≤\\xa00.05).ConclusionsWe observed that synbiotic 1 and 2 beneficially affected the examined characteristics on the 1st and 42nd day of life. The obtained results allow us to conclude that the use of synbiotics significantly affect gut structure which should contribute to improvement in nutrient absorption by the gut.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundGenomic growth curves are generally defined only in terms of population mean; an alternative approach that has not yet been exploited in genomic analyses of growth curves is the Quantile Regression (QR). This methodology allows for the estimation of marker effects at different levels of the variable of interest. We aimed to propose and evaluate a regularized quantile regression for SNP marker effect estimation of pig growth curves, as well as to identify the chromosome regions of the most relevant markers and to estimate the genetic individual weight trajectory over time (genomic growth curve) under different quantiles (levels).ResultsThe regularized quantile regression (RQR) enabled the discovery, at different levels of interest (quantiles), of the most relevant markers allowing for the identification of QTL regions. We found the same relevant markers simultaneously affecting different growth curve parameters (mature weight and maturity rate): two (ALGA0096701 and ALGA0029483) for RQR(0.2), one (ALGA0096701) for RQR(0.5), and one (ALGA0003761) for RQR(0.8). Three average genomic growth curves were obtained and the behavior was explained by the curve in quantile 0.2, which differed from the others.ConclusionsRQR allowed for the construction of genomic growth curves, which is the key to identifying and selecting the most desirable animals for breeding purposes. Furthermore, the proposed model enabled us to find, at different levels of interest (quantiles), the most relevant markers for each trait (growth curve parameter estimates) and their respective chromosomal positions (identification of new QTL regions for growth curves in pigs). These markers can be exploited under the context of marker assisted selection while aiming to change the shape of pig growth curves.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIntra-uterine crowding (IUC) observed in hyperprolific sows impairs myofiber hyperplasia and overall fetal growth. Arginine supplementation (ARG) in gestation diets has been shown to positively affect litter and muscle development. The study objective was to assess whether the effect of ARG on offspring characteristics, with special emphasis on myofiber hyperplasia, differs under IUC conditions from these responses, because in that situation growth retardation is particularly prevalent due to reduced fetal nutrient supply. Unilateral oviduct ligation (OL) was used as a model for an uncrowded and hyperprolificacy (IN) as a model for a crowded intra-uterine environment.MethodsFive OL and five IN sows were fed a diet supplemented daily with either 43 g l-alanine (Ctrl) or 25 g l-arginine from d 14 to 28 of gestation in a cross-over design (two periods: 5th and 6th parity). At farrowing, two male and two female offspring, respectively, with a low and intermediate birth weight (BtW) were selected. After euthanization, the Semitendinosus muscle (STM) was removed and weighed, and the light and dark portions (STMd and STMl) were prepared for myofiber histochemistry using ATPase staining and the entire STM for gene expression analysis of myogenesis-related genes using RT-qPCR. In addition, various organs were removed and weighed. Data were analyzed using the MIXED model in SYSTAT.ResultsNo effect of either IUC or dietary treatment was found in litter characteristics. Offspring of ARG sows displayed a greater muscle area in STM (P < 0.01) as a result of the greater myofiber hyperplasia (P < 0.01). The increase was more distinct in the STMl (P < 0.05) than in the STMd (P = 0.131). Offspring of OL sows were heavier at birth (P < 0.01), had a heavier STM (P < 0.05), liver (P < 0.01) and kidney (P < 0.05), but when expressed relative to birth weight, these differences were absent. In addition, IUC had an effect (P < 0.05) on the expression of one of the myogenesis-related genes investigated.ConclusionsIndependent from the extent of IUC, ARG improved BtW, muscle and organ weights and myofiber hyperplasia in offspring.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe objective of the present study was to estimate (co)variance components of female fertility traits in Chinese Holsteins, considering fertility traits in different parities as different traits. Data on 88,647 females with 215,632 records (parities) were collected during 2000 to 2014 from 32 herds in the Sanyuan Lvhe Dairy Cattle Center, Beijing, China. The analyzed female fertility traits included interval from calving to first insemination, interval from first to last insemination, days open, conception rate at first insemination, number of inseminations per conception and non-return rates within 56 days after first insemination.ResultsThe descriptive statistics showed that the average fertility of heifers was superior to that of cows. Moreover, the genetic correlations between the performances of a trait in heifers and in cows were all moderate to high but far from one, which suggested that the performances of a trait in heifers and cows should be considered as different but genetically correlated traits in genetic evaluations. On the other hand, genetic correlations between performances of a trait in different parities of cows were greater than 0.87, with only a few exceptions, but variances were not homogeneous across parities for some traits. The estimated heritabilities of female fertility traits were low; all were below 0.049 (except for interval from calving to first insemination). Additionally, the heritabilities of the heifer interval traits were lower than those of the corresponding cow interval traits. Moreover, the heritabilities of the interval traits were higher than those of the threshold traits when measuring similar fertility functions. In general, estimated genetic correlations between traits were highly consistent with the biological categories of the female fertility traits.ConclusionsInterval from calving to first insemination, interval from first to last insemination and non-return rates within 56 days after first insemination are recommended to be included in the selection index of the Chinese Holstein population. The parameters estimated in the present study will facilitate the development of a genetic evaluation system for female fertility traits to improve the reproduction efficiency of Chinese Holsteins.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundTwo trials were performed to evaluate a partially defatted Hermetia illucens (HI) larvae meal as potential feed ingredient in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) diets. In the first trial, 360 trout (178.9\\xa0±\\xa09.8\\xa0g of mean initial body weight) were randomly divided into three experimental groups (4 tanks/treatment, 30 fish/tank). The fish were fed for 78 days with isonitrogenous, isolipidic and isoenergetic diets containing increasing levels of HI, on as fed basis: 0% (HI0, control diet), 25% (HI25) and 50% (HI50) of fish meal substitution, corresponding to dietary inclusion levels of 0, 20% and 40%. In the second trial, 36 trout (4 tanks/treatment, 3 fish/tank) were used to evaluate the in vivo apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of the same diets used in the first trial.ResultsSurvival, growth performance, condition factor, somatic indexes, and dorsal fillet physical quality parameters were not affected by diet. The highest dietary inclusion of HI larvae meal increased dry matter and ether extract contents of trout dorsal fillet. The use of HI larvae meal induced a decrease of valuable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) even if differences were only reported at the highest level of HI inclusion. The insect meal worsened the lipids health indexes of the same muscle. Dietary inclusion of insect meal did not alter the villus height of the fish. No differences were found among treatments in relation to ADC of ether extract and gross energy, while ADC of dry matter and crude protein were higher in HI25 if compared to HI50.ConclusionsThe obtained results showed that a partially defatted HI larvae meal can be used as feed ingredient in trout diets up to 40% of inclusion level without impacting survival, growth performance, condition factor, somatic indexes, dorsal fillet physical quality parameters, and intestinal morphology of the fish. However, further investigations on specific feeding strategies and diet formulations are needed to limit the observed negative effects of the insect meal on the FA composition of dorsal muscle.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn beef cattle, changes in the periovulatory endocrine milieu are associated with fertility and conceptus growth. A large preovulatory follicle (POF) and the resulting elevated concentrations of progesterone (P4) during diestrus positively affect pregnancy rates. Amino acids (AA) are important components of maternally derived secretions that are crucial for embryonic survival before implantation. The hypothesis is that the size of the POF and the concentration of P4 in early diestrus modulate the endometrial abundance of SLC transcripts related to AA transport and metabolism and subsequently impact luminal concentrations of AA. The follicle growth of Nelore cows was manipulated to produce two experimental groups: large POF and CL (LF-LCL group) and small POF and CL (SF-SCL group). On Day 4 (D4; Experiment 1) and Day 7 (D7; Experiment 2) after GnRH-induced ovulation (GnRH treatment\\u2009=\\u2009D0), the animals were slaughtered and uterine tissues and uterine washings were collected. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression levels of AA transporters in D4 and D7 endometrial tissues. The concentrations of AA were quantified in D4 and D7 uterine washings by HPLC.ResultsTranscript results show that, on D4, SLC6A6, SLC7A4, SLC17A5, SLC38A1, SLC38A7 and SCLY and on D7 SLC1A4, SLC6A1, SLC6A14, SLC7A4, SLC7A7, SLC7A8, SLC17A5, SLC38A1, SLC38A7, SLC43A2 and DDO were more abundant in the endometria of cows from the LF-LCL group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, concentrations of AA in the uterine lumen were influenced by the endocrine profiles of the mother. In this context, D4 uterine washings revealed that greater concentrations of taurine, alanine and α-aminobutyric acid were present in SF-SCL (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In contrast, lower concentrations of valine and cystathionine were quantified on D7 uterine washings from SF-SCL cows (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionThe present study revealed an association between the abundance of transcripts related to AA transport and metabolism in the endometrium and specific periovulatory endocrine profiles related to the receptive status of the mother. Such insights suggest that AAs are involved in uterine function to support embryo development.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe beneficial effects of Lactobacillus probiotics in animal production are often strain-related. Different strains from the same species may exert different weight-gain effect on hosts in vivo. Most lactobacilli are selected based on their in vitro activities, and their metabolism and regulation on the intestine based on strain-related characters are largely unexplored. The objective of the present study was to study the in vivo effects of the three lactobacilli on growth performance and to compare the differential effects of the strains on the faecal microbiota and ileum mucosa proteomics of piglets.MethodsThree hundred and sixty piglets were assigned to one of four treatments, which included an antibiotics-treated control and three experimental groups supplemented with the three lactobacilli, L. salivarius G1-1, L. reuteri G8-5 and L. reuteri G22-2, respectively. Piglets were weighed and the feed intake was recorded to compare the growth performance. The faecal lactobacilli and coliform was quantified using quantitative PCR and the faecal microbiota was profiled by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The proteomic approach was applied to compare the differential expression of proteins in the ileum mucosa.ResultsNo statistical difference was found among the three Lactobacillus-treated groups in animal growth performance compared with the antibiotics-treated group (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Supplementation of lactobacilli in diets significantly increased the relative 16S rRNA gene copies of Lactobacillus genus on both d 14 and d 28 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05)., and the bacterial community profiles based on DGGE from the lactobacilli-treated groups were distinctly different from the antibiotics-treated group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The ileum mucosa of piglets responded to all Lactobacillus supplementation by producing more newly expressed proteins and the identified proteins were all associated with the functions beneficial for stabilization of cell structure. Besides, some other up-regulated and down-regulated proteins in different Lactobacillus-treated groups showed the expression of proteins were partly strain-related.ConclusionsAll the three lactobacilli in this study show comparable effects to antibiotics on piglets growth performance. The three lactobacilli were found able to modify intestinal microbiota and mucosa proteomics. The regulation of protein expression in the intestinal mucosa are partly associated with the strains administrated in feed.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundCorn and soybean meal (SBM) are two of the most common feed ingredients used in pig feeds. However, a variety of antinutritional factors (ANFs) present in corn and SBM can interfere with the bioavailability of nutrients and have negative health effects on the pigs. In the present study, two-stage fermentation using Bacillus subtilis followed by Enterococcus faecium was carried out to degrade ANFs and improve the nutritional quality of corn and SBM mixed feed. Furthermore, the microbial composition and in vitro nutrient digestibility of inoculated mixed feed were determined and compared those of the uninoculated controls.ResultsDuring the fermentation process, B. subtilis and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were the main dominant bacteria in the solid-state fermented inoculated feed, and fermentation produced a large amount of lactic acid (170 mmoL/kg), which resulted in a lower pH (5.0 vs. 6.4) than the fermented uninoculated feed. The amounts of soybean antigenic proteins (β-conglycinin and glycinin) in mixed feed were significantly decreased after first-stage fermentation with B. subtilis. Inoculated mixed feed following two-stage fermentation contained greater concentratioin of crude protein (CP), ash and total phosphorus (P) compared to uninoculated feed, whereas the concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), hemicellulose and phytate P in fermendted inoculated feed declined (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by 38%, 53%, and 46%, respectively. Notably, the content of trichloroacetic acid soluble protein (TCA-SP), particularly that of small peptides and free amino acids (AA), increased 6.5 fold following two-stage fermentation. There was no difference in the total AA content between fermented inoculated and uninoculated feed. However, aromatic AAs (Phe and Tyr) and Lys in inoculated feed increased, and some polar AAs, including Arg, Asp, and Glu, decreased compared with the uninoculated feed. In vitro dry matter and CP digestibility of inoculated feed improved (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared with the uninoculated feed.ConclusionsOur results suggest that two-stage fermentation using B. subtilis followed by E. faecium is an effective approach to improve the quality of corn-soybean meal mixed feed.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe aim of the study was to analyze the lifetime and culling reasons for boars used in insemination centers (AI centers).MethodsThe data collected from 355 culled boars from 1998 to 2013 included: age at start of semen collection, boar herd life, culling reason, daily gain and lean meat content, and number of ejaculates not meeting sales requirements after dilution. Culling reasons were divided into 7 groups: low semen value (LSV), low or lack of libido (LL), leg problems (LP), infectious diseases (ID), old age (OA), reduced demand for semen from the given boar (RD), and others (OT).ResultsThe most common culling reasons for boars were LSV (23.7%) and RD (22.5%). It was observed that the lowest daily gains were noted in boars culled due to OA. Boars culled due to OA and RD were maintained in production for the longest time (over 1000 d), for LSV and ID retention was about 700 d, and due to LL below 400 d. The survival probability was over 0.9 until 1.5\\xa0yr, and just over 0.2 until 4\\xa0yr. The highest relative frequency was observed in the 36th and 42nd mo of life (over 16%). Hazard risk analysis revealed a more than 10 times higher risk of culling in the case of LL, ID or OT, in comparison to OA.ConclusionsThe results can be used as a direct point of reference for the identification of emerging problems in AI boar exploitation and the development of an appropriate culling policy in AI centers.',\n",

The experimental diets were: a basal diet and two diets prepared by substituting 250\\xa0g/kg (w/w) of the basal diet with BSFp or BSFh, respectively.ResultsSignificant differences were found between BSFp and BSFh meals for ATTDC of the nutrients: BSFp resulted more digestible than BSFh, except for ATTDC of CP which did not differed between meals, while a statistical trend was observed for ATTDC of DM and EE. The AME and AMEn values were significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) different between the two BSF meals, with higher levels for BSFp (16.25 and 14.87\\xa0MJ/kg DM, respectively). The AIDC of the AA in BSFp ranged from 0.44 to 0.92, while in BSFh they ranged from 0.45 to 0.99. No significant differences were observed for the AA digestibility (0.77 and 0.80 for BSFp and BSFh, respectively), except for glutamic acid, proline and serine that were more digestible in the BSFh meal (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsDefatted BSF meals can be considered as an excellent source of AME and digestible AA for broilers with a better efficient nutrient digestion. These considerations suggested the effective utilization of defatted BSF larvae meal in poultry feed formulation.',\n",
       " 'A conventional diet based on corn and soybean meal fed to pigs is usually provided in a mash form and in most cases, processing other than grinding and mixing is not used. However, due to the high cost of energy in pig diets, use of high fiber ingredients such as soybean hulls, distillers dried grains with solubles, and wheat middlings has increased. High fiber concentrations in the diet usually results in reduced energy and nutrient digestibility due to the low capacity of pigs to digest fiber, which negatively impacts growth performance and carcass composition of the pigs. Feed processing technologies such as changes in grinding procedures, expansion, extrusion, pelleting, use of enzymes or chemical treatments may, however, be used to solubilize some of the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions that form the cell wall of plants in the ingredients, and therefore, increase nutrient availability. This may have a positive effect on energy digestibility, and therefore, also on pig growth performance and carcass composition, but effects of different feed technologies on the nutritional value of feed ingredients and diets fed to pigs are not fully understood. It has however, been demonstrated that reduced particle size of cereal grains usually results in increased digestibility of energy, primarily due to increased digestibility of starch. Extrusion or expansion of ingredients or diets may also increase energy digestibility and it appears that the increase is greater in high fiber diets than in diets with lower concentrations of fiber. Chemical treatments have not consistently improved energy or nutrient digestibility, but a number of different enzymes may be used to increase the digestibility of phosphorus, calcium, or energy. Thus, there are several opportunities for using feed technology to improve the nutritional value of diets fed to pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe present experiment was performed to assess the effects of different sources of milk on the growth performance, serum metabolism, immunity, and intestinal development of calves. Eighty-four Holstein male neonatal calves were assigned to one of the following four treatment groups: those that received bunk tank milk (BTM), untreated waste milk (UWM), pasteurized waste milk (PWM), and acidified waste milk (AWM) for 21 d.ResultsCalves in the BTM and AWM groups consumed more starter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than those in the UWM group. Average daily gain in the UWM group was the highest (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Calves exhibited the highest (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) serum total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, growth hormone, immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM concentrations in the UWM group, highest malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-α in the PWM group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and highest glutathione peroxidase and IgG in the BTM group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The jejunum and ileum of the calves in all treatments presented a slight inflammatory response. The jejunal inflammation scores were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the UWM and AWM groups than the BTM group; the ileal inflammation scores increased more (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the AWM group than the BTM group. Jejunal immunohistochemical scores (IHS) were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the PWM and AWM groups than the BTM group. Compared to the other three groups, calves feeding on BTM had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) ileal IHS. Jejunal interleukin(IL)-1β, IL-8, and IL-10 mRNA expression in the UWM group was the highest (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Calves fed AWM increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) mRNA expression of IL-8 and toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in the jejunum and IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in the mesenteric lymph nodes.ConclusionsOverall, bunk tank milk is the best choice for calf raising compared to waste milk. The efficiency of feeding pasteurized and acidified waste milk are comparable, and the acidification of waste milk is an acceptable labor-saving and diarrhea-preventing feed for young calves.',\n",

       " 'Fluoroacetate producing plants grow worldwide and it is believed they produce this toxic compound as a defence mechanism against grazing by herbivores. Ingestion by livestock often results in fatal poisonings, which causes significant economic problems to commercial farmers in many countries such as Australia, Brazil and South Africa. Several approaches have been adopted to protect livestock from the toxicity with limited success including fencing, toxic plant eradication and agents that bind the toxin. Genetically modified bacteria capable of degrading fluoroacetate have been able to protect ruminants from fluoroacetate toxicity under experimental conditions but concerns over the release of these microbes into the environment have prevented the application of this technology. Recently, a native bacterium from an Australian bovine rumen was isolated which can degrade fluoroacetate. This bacterium, strain MFA1, which belongs to the Synergistetes phylum degrades fluoroacetate to fluoride ions and acetate. The discovery and isolation of this bacterium provides a new opportunity to detoxify fluoroacetate in the rumen. This review focuses on fluoroacetate toxicity in ruminant livestock, the mechanism of fluoroacetate toxicity, tolerance of some animals to fluoroaceate, previous attempts to mitigate toxicity, aerobic and anaerobic microbial degradation of fluoroacetate, and future directions to overcome fluoroacetate toxicity.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAn experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of feed restriction (FR) and sex on the quantitative and qualitative carcass traits of Morada Nova lambs. Thirty-five animals with an initial body weight of 14.5\\u2009±\\u20090.89\\xa0kg and age of 120 d were used in a completely randomized study with a 3\\u2009×\\u20093 factorial scheme consisting of three sexes (11 entire males, 12 castrated males and 12 females) and three levels of feeding (ad libitum – AL and 30% and 60% FR).ResultsEntire males presented greater hot and cold carcass weights (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), followed by castrated males and females. However, the hot carcass yield was higher for females and castrated males than for entire males. Luminosity values were influenced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by sex, with entire males presenting higher values than castrated males and females. Females showed higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentrations of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid in the meat of the longissimus thoracis muscle. The meat of animals submitted to AL intake and 30% FR showed similar (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) concentrations, and the concentrations of palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and conjugated linoleic acid were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than those of animals with 60% FR. The meat of females had a higher ω6/ω3 ratio and lower h/H ratio, and females had greater levels of feeding. The meat of animals on the 60% FR diet had a greater ω6/ω3 ratio, lower h/H ratio and lower concentration of desirable fatty acids in addition to a greater atherogenicity index (AI) and thrombogenicity index (TI).ConclusionLambs of different sexes had carcasses with different quantitative traits without total influence on the chemical and physical meat characteristics. The lipid profile of the meat was less favorable to consumer health when the animals were female or submitted to 60% feed restriction.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAmong various feed additives currently used in poultry nutrition, an important role is played by bioactive substances, including prebiotics. The beneficial effect of these bioactive substances on the gastrointestinal tract and immune system give rise to improvements in broiler health and performance nutrition, thus increasing the productivity of these birds. An innovative method for introducing bioactive substances into chickens is the in ovo injection into eggs intended for hatching. The aim of the study was to evaluate the development of histomorphological parameters of the duodenum and productivity in chickens injected in ovo with the prebiotic DiNovo® (extract of Laminaria species of seaweed, BioAtlantis Ltd., Ireland) on d 12 of incubation, under large - scale, high density poultry production conditions.ResultsThere was no significant impact of the injection of DiNovo® prebiotic on the production parameters of broiler chickens (body weight, FCR, EBI and mortality) obtained on d 42 of rearing. No significant impact of the DiNovo® injection on the duodenum weight and length was observed, as well as on the CSA, diameter and muscular layer thickness of the duodenum. The in ovo injection of DiNovo® significantly increased the width of the duodenal villi (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and crypt depth (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) of chickens on d 21 of rearing. Other histomorphological parameters of duodenal villi at d 42 of chickens rearing such as: the height, width, and cross section area of villi were significantly greater in chickens from the control group compared to those from the DiNovo® group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 and P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).ConclusionsIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that injection of DiNovo® prebiotic into the air chamber of egg significantly influences the histomorphological parameters on d 21 of rearing without negatively affecting productivity in chickens at the end of rearing.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe growth rate often varies among individual broilers of the same breed under a common management condition. To investigate whether a variation in the growth rate is associated with a difference in hormone levels and myogenic gene expression profile in broilers, a feeding trial was conducted with 10,000 newly hatched Ross 308 chicks in a commercial production facility under standard management. At 38 d of age, 30 fast-, 30 medium-, and 30 slow-growing broilers were selected among 600 healthy male individuals. The levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and growth hormone in the serum or breast muscle were assayed by ELISA or RIA kits, and the expression levels of several representative pro- and anti-myogenic genes in the breast muscle were also measured by real-time PCR.ResultsResults showed that both absolute and relative weights of the breast muscle were in linear positive correlations with the body weight of broilers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Fast-growing broilers had higher concentrations of IGF-1 than slow-growing broilers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in both the serum and breast muscle. The serum concentration of T3 was significantly higher in fast-growing birds than in slow-growing birds (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). However, no difference was observed in growth hormone or T4 concentration among three groups of birds. Additionally, a decreased expression of an anti-myogenic gene (myostatin) and increased expressions of pro-myogenic genes such as myogenic differentiation factor 1, myogenin, muscle regulatory factor 4, myogenic factor 5, IGF-1, and myocyte enhancer factor 2B, C, and D were observed in fast-growing broilers (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), relative to slow-growing broilers.ConclusionsCollectively, these findings suggested that the growth rate is linked to the hormone and myogenic gene expression levels in broiler chickens. Some of these parameters such as serum concentrations of IGF-1 and T3 could be employed to breed for enhanced growth.',\n",
       " 'Maternal undernutrition or overnutrition during pregnancy alters organ structure, impairs prenatal and neonatal growth and development, and reduces feed efficiency for lean tissue gains in pigs. These adverse effects may be carried over to the next generation or beyond. This phenomenon of the transgenerational impacts is known as fetal programming, which is mediated by stable and heritable alterations of gene expression through covalent modifications of DNA and histones without changes in DNA sequences (namely, epigenetics). The mechanisms responsible for the epigenetic regulation of protein expression and functions include chromatin remodeling; DNA methylation (occurring at the 5´-position of cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides); and histone modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination). Like maternal malnutrition, undernutrition during the neonatal period also reduces growth performance and feed efficiency (weight gain:feed intake; also known as weight-gain efficiency) in postweaning pigs by 5–10%, thereby increasing the days necessary to reach the market body-weight. Supplementing functional amino acids (e.g., arginine and glutamine) and vitamins (e.g., folate) play a key role in activating the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and regulating the provision of methyl donors for DNA and protein methylation. Therefore, these nutrients are beneficial for the dietary treatment of metabolic disorders in offspring with intrauterine growth restriction or neonatal malnutrition. The mechanism-based strategies hold great promise for the improvement of the efficiency of pork production and the sustainability of the global swine industry.',\n",
       " 'Elevated concentrations of plasma fatty acids in transition dairy cows are significantly associated with increased disease susceptibility and poor lactation performance. The main source of plasma fatty acids throughout the transition period is lipolysis from adipose tissue depots. During this time, plasma fatty acids serve as a source of calories mitigating the negative energy balance prompted by copious milk synthesis and limited dry matter intake. Past research has demonstrated that lipolysis in the adipose organ is a complex process that includes not only the activation of lipolytic pathways in response to neural, hormonal, or paracrine stimuli, but also important changes in the structure and cellular distribution of the tissue in a process known as adipose tissue remodeling. This process involves an inflammatory response with immune cell migration, proliferation of the cellular components of the stromal vascular fraction, and changes in the extracellular matrix. This review summarizes current knowledge on lipolysis in dairy cattle, expands on the new field of adipose tissue remodeling, and discusses how these biological processes affect transition cow health and productivity.',\n",
       " 'Precise knowledge of the actual nutritional value of individual feedstuffs and complete diets for pigs is important for efficient livestock production. Methods of assessment of protein and energy values in pig feeds have been briefly described. In vivo determination of protein and energy values of feeds in pigs are time-consuming, expensive and very often require the use of surgically-modified animals. There is a need for more simple, rapid, inexpensive and reproducible methods for routine feed evaluation. Protein and energy values of pig feeds can be estimated using the following alternative methods: 1) prediction equations based on chemical composition; 2) animal models as rats, cockerels and growing pigs for adult animals; 3) rapid methods, such as the mobile nylon bag technique and in vitro methods. Alternative methods developed for predicting the total tract and ileal digestibility of nutrients including amino acids in feedstuffs and diets for pigs have been reviewed. This article focuses on two in vitro methods that can be used for the routine evaluation of amino acid ileal digestibility and energy value of pig feeds and on factors affecting digestibility determined in vivo in pigs and by alternative methods. Validation of alternative methods has been carried out by comparing the results obtained using these methods with those acquired in vivo in pigs. In conclusion, energy and protein values of pig feeds may be estimated with satisfactory precision in rats and by the two- or three-step in vitro methods providing equations for the calculation of standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids and metabolizable energy content. The use of alternative methods of feed evaluation is an important way for reduction of stressful animal experiments.',\n",

These efficiencies relative to the naive approach using the same model will increase with increases in the number of observations.ConclusionsEfficient Leave-one-out cross validation strategies are presented here, requiring little more effort than a single analysis.',\n",
       " 'Mammalian spermatogenesis contains three continuous and organized processes, by which spermatogonia undergo mitosis and differentiate to spermatocytes, follow on meiosis to form haploid spermatids and ultimately transform into spermatozoa. These processes require an accurately, spatially and temporally regulated gene expression patterns. The microRNAs are a novel class of post-transcriptional regulators. Cumulating evidences have demonstrated that microRNAs are expressed in a cell-specific or stage-specific manner during spermatogenesis. In this review, we focus on the roles of microRNAs in spermatogenesis. We highlight that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is involved in the biogenesis of microRNAs and miRNA regulates the m6A modification on mRNA, and that specific miRNAs have been exploited as potential biomarkers for the male factor infertility, which will provide insightful understanding of microRNA roles in spermatogenesis.',\n",

The design allowed the calculation of NE values of corn, soybean meal and rapeseed meals according to the difference method. In Exp.2, 175 growing pigs (initial BW\\u2009=\\u200936.0\\u2009±\\u20095.2\\xa0kg) were fed 1 of 5 diets for 28 d, with five pigs per pen and seven replications (pens) per treatment in order to validate the measured energy values. Diets were a corn-soybean meal diet and four diets including 10% or 20% EP-RSM and 10% or 20% SE-RSM.ResultsThe NE of corn, soybean meal, EP-RSM and SE-RSM were 12.46, 11.34, 11.71 and 8.83\\xa0MJ/kg DM, respectively. The NE to ME ratio of corn (78%) was similar to tabular values, however, the NE to ME ratios of soybean meal (70%) and rapeseed meal (76%) were greater than tabular values. The greater NE value in EP-RSM than in SE-RSM is consistent with its higher EE content. Increasing EP-RSM or SE-RSM did not affect the growth performance of pigs and the caloric efficiency of NE was comparable for all diets.ConclusionsThe NE of EP-RSM was similar to soybean meal, and both were greater than SE-RSM. The DE, ME and NE values measured in Exp.1 are confirmed by results of Exp. 2 with comparable caloric efficiencies of DE, ME or NE for all diets.',\n",
       " 'Yeast of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SCY) origin has over long time been incorporated into domestic animal diets. In calves, several products have offered improved performance and health. Although several types of research have been completed, the mode of action of SCY is not clear in calves. Under this review, we have highlighted the works available in the literature on the use of SCY in calves performance, health, immunity, and the gut environment. Both active live yeast and yeast culture have positive effects on growth, rumen, small intestines, immunity and general health of the calf. Specifically, SCY can improve DMI, growth, feed efficiency and reduce diarrhea in calves. Furthermore, subtle improvements are seen in rumen fermentation (increased butyrate production) and rumen papillae growth. These positive results are, however, more pronounced in calves that are under stress or exposed to significant levels of disease-causing agents. There is a need for further research in areas such as gut morphology, gut microbiology and immunity using latest molecular methods to fully understand how SCY helps the growth and development of calves.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundImmune dysfunction and a higher risk of uterine infections are characteristics of the transition into lactation in dairy cows. The supply of complexed trace minerals, which are more bioavailable, could help overcome the greater needs of these nutrients in tissues around parturition and early lactation.ResultsTwenty Holstein cows received an oral bolus with a mix of inorganic trace minerals (INO) or complexed trace minerals (AAC) to achieve 75, 65, 11, and 1 ppm supplemental Zn, Mn, Cu, and Co, respectively, in the total diet dry matter from -30 d through +30 d relative to parturition. Blood for polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) isolation was collected at -30, -15, +10, and + 30 d relative to parturition, whereas endometrium biopsies were performed at +14 and +30 d. Feeding AAC led to greater PMNL expression of genes related with inflammation response (DDX58), oxidative stress response (MPO), eicosanoid metabolism (PLA2G4A and ALOX5AP), transcription regulation (PPARG), and cellular adhesion (TLN1). The upregulation by AAC in endometrium of genes related with inflammation response (TLR2, TLR4, NFKB1, TNF, IL6, IL1B, IL10, IL8), prostaglandin synthesis (PTGS2, PTGES), and antioxidant responses (NFE2L2, SOD1) indicated a faster remodeling of uterine tissue and potentially greater capacity to control a local bacterial invasion.ConclusionsData indicate that trace mineral supplementation from amino acid complexes improves PMNL activity and allows the prompt recovery of uterine tissue during early lactation. As such, the benefits of complexed trace minerals extend beyond an improvement of liver function and productive performance.',\n",

However, there is little information on the effect of Bacillus spp. in combination with different dietary crude protein (CP) levels on the ileal digestibility and microbiota composition. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of Bacillus spp. supplementation to low- (LP) and high-protein diets (HP) on ileal CP and amino acid (AA) digestibility and intestinal microbiota composition.MethodsEight ileally cannulated pigs with an initial body weight of 28.5\\xa0kg were randomly allocated to a row-column design with 8 pigs and 3 periods of 16\\xa0d each. The assay diets were based on wheat-barley-soybean meal with two protein levels: LP (14% CP, as-fed) and HP diet (18% CP, as-fed). The LP and HP diets were supplemented with or without Bacillus spp. at a level of 0.04% (as-fed). The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA was determined. Bacterial community composition from ileal digesta was analyzed by Illumina amplicon sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR. Data were analyzed as a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial design using the GLIMMIX procedures of SAS.ResultsThe supplementation with Bacillus spp. did not affect both AID and SID of CP and AA in growing pigs. Moreover, there was no difference in AID of CP and AA between HP and LP diets, but SID of cystine, glutamic acid, glycine, and proline was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in pigs fed the HP diets. The HP diets increased abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp., (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and by amplicon sequencing the latter was identified as predominant genus in microbiota from HP with Bacillus spp., whereas dietary supplementation of Bacillus spp. increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) abundance of Roseburia spp..ConclusionsThe HP diet increased abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.. The supplementation of Bacillus spp. resulted in a higher abundance of healthy gut associated bacteria without affecting ileal CP and AA digestibility, whereas LP diet may reduce the flow of undigested protein to the large intestine of pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundA possible option to meet the increased demand of forage for dairy industry is to use the agricultural by-products, such as corn stover. However, nutritional value of crop residues is low and we have been seeking technologies to improve the value. A feeding trial was performed to evaluate the effects of four levels of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP; Original XP; Diamond V) on lactation performance and rumen fermentation in mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows fed a diet containing low-quality forage. Eighty dairy cows were randomly assigned into one of four treatments: basal diet supplemented with 0, 60, 120, or 180 g/d of SCFP per head mixed with 180, 120, 60, or 0 g of corn meal, respectively. The experiment lasted for 10 wks, with the first 2 weeks for adaptation.ResultsDry matter intake was found to be similar (P > 0.05) among the treatments. There was an increasing trend in milk production (linear, P ≤ 0.10) with the increasing level of SCFP supplementation, with no effects on contents of milk components (P > 0.05). Supplementation of SCFP linearly increased (P < 0.05) the N conversion, without affecting rumen pH and ammonia-N (P > 0.05). Increasing level of SCFP linearly increased (P < 0.05) concentrations of ruminal total volatile fatty acids, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, with no difference in molar proportion of individual acids (P > 0.05). The population of fungi and certain cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogenes) increased linearly (P < 0.05) but those of lactate-utilizing (Selenomonas ruminantium and Megasphaera elsdenii) and lactate-producing bacteria (Streptococcus bovis) decreased linearly (P ≤ 0.01) with increasing level of SCFP. The urinary purine derivatives increased linearly (P < 0.05) in response to SCFP supplementation, indicating that SCFP supplementation may benefit for microbial protein synthesis in the rumen.ConclusionsThe SCFP supplementation was effective in maintaining milk persistency of mid-lactation cows receiving diets containing low-quality forage. The beneficial effect of SCFP could be attributed to improved rumen function; 1) microbial population shift toward greater rumen fermentation efficiency indicated by higher rumen fungi and cellulolytic bacteria and lower lactate producing bacteria, and 2) rumen microbial fermentation toward greater supply of energy and protein indicated by greater ruminal VFA concentration and increased N conversion. Effects of SCFP were dose-depended and greater effects being observed with higher levels of supplementation and the effect was more noticeable during the high THI environment.',\n",

Low (LBW) and normal birth weight (NBW) piglets were compared as they might react differently to stressors caused by artificial rearing. In total, 42 pairs of LBW and NBW piglets from 16 litters suckled the sow until d19 of age or were artificially reared starting at d3 until d19 of age. Blood and tissue samples that were collected after euthanasia at 0, 3, 5, 8 and 19\\xa0d of age. Histology, ELISA, and Ussing chamber analysis were used to study proximal and distal small intestine histo-morphology, proliferation, apoptosis, tight junction protein expression, and permeability. Furthermore, small intestine, liver and systemic redox parameters (GSH, GSSG, GSH-Px and MDA) were investigated using HPLC.ResultsLBW and NBW artificially reared piglets weighed respectively 40 and 33% more than LBW and NBW sow-reared piglets at d19 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Transferring piglets to a nursery at d3 resulted in villus atrophy, increased intestinal FD-4 and HRP permeability and elevated GSSG/GSH ratio in the distal small intestine at d5 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). GSH concentrations in the proximal small intestine remained stable, while they decreased in the liver (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). From d5 until d19, villus width and crypt depth increased, whereas PCNA, caspase-3, occludin and claudin-3 protein expressions were reduced.

       " 'BackgroundDietary saturated (SFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids can highly affect reproductive functions by providing additional energy, modulating the biochemical properties of tissues, and hormone secretions. In precocial mammals such as domestic guinea pigs the offspring is born highly developed. Gestation might be the most critical reproductive period in this species and dietary fatty acids may profoundly influence the gestational effort. We therefore determined the hormonal status at conception, the reproductive success, and body mass changes during gestation in guinea pigs maintained on diets high in PUFAs or SFAs, or a control diet.ResultsThe diets significantly affected the females’ plasma fatty acid status at conception, while cortisol and estrogen levels did not differ among groups. SFA females exhibited a significantly lower body mass and litter size, while the individual birth mass of pups did not differ among groups and a general higher pup mortality rate in larger litters was diminished by PUFAs and SFAs. The gestational effort, determined by a mother’s body mass gain during gestation, increased with total litter mass, whereas this increase was lowest in SFA and highest in PUFA individuals. The mother’s body mass after parturition did not differ among groups and was positively affected by the total litter mass in PUFA females.ConclusionsWhile SFAs reduce the litter size, but also the gestational effort as a consequence, PUFA supplementation may contribute to an adjustment of energy accumulations to the total litter mass, which may both favor a mother’s body condition at parturition and perhaps increase the offspring survival at birth.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn farm animals, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) effect on economic performance remains hot-topic for breeding and genetic selection. Here, 53 maternal lineages of Small-tailed Han sheep were used to investigate the association of mitochondrial DNA variations and the lambing litter size.ResultsSequence sweeping of the mitochondrial coding regions discovered 31 non-synonymous mutations, and the association study revealed that T7719G in mtDNA tRNA-Lys gene was associated with litter size (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), manifesting 0.29 lambs per litter between the G and T carriers. Furthermore, using the mixed linear model, we assayed the potential association of the ovine litter size and haplogroups and multiple-level mtDNA haplotypes, including general haplotypes, assembled haplotypes of electron transport chain contained sequences (H-ETC), mitochondrial respiratory complex contained sequences (H-MRC) and mitochondrial genes (H-gene, including polypeptide-coding genes, rRNA genes and tRNA genes). The strategy for assembled mitochondrial haplotypes was proposed for the first time in mtDNA association analyses on economic traits, although none of the significant relations could be concluded (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). In addition, the nuclear major gene BMPR1B was significantly correlated with litter size in the flock (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), however, did not interact with mtDNA T7719G mutation (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05).ConclusionsOur results highlight mutations of ovine mitochondrial coding genes, suggesting T7719G in tRNA-Lys gene be a potentially useful marker for selection of sheep litter size.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIndigestible markers are commonly utilized in digestion studies, but the complete disappearance or maximum appearance of a marker in feces can be affected by diet composition, feed intake, or an animal’s BW. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of previous (Phase 1, P1) and current- (Phase 2, P2) diet composition on marker disappearance (Cr) and appearance (Ti) in pigs fed 3 diets differing in NDF content.ResultsWhen pigs were maintained on the 25.1, 72.5, and 125.0\\xa0g/kg NDF diets, it took 5.1, 4.1, and 2.5 d, respectively, for Cr levels to decrease below the limit of quantitation; or 4.6, 3.7, or 2.8 d, respectively, for Ti to be maximized. These effects were not, however, independent of the previous diet as indicated by the interaction between P1 and P2 diets on fecal marker concentrations (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). When dietary NDF increased from P1 to P2, it took less time for fecal Cr to decrease or fecal Ti to be maximized (an average of 2.5 d), than if NDF decreased from P1 to P2 where it took longer for fecal Cr to decrease or fecal Ti to be maximized (an average of 3.4 d).ConclusionsBecause of the wide range in excretion times reported in the literature and improved laboratory methods for elemental detection, the data suggests that caution must be taken in considering dietary fiber concentrations of the past and currently fed diets so that no previous dietary marker addition remains in the digestive tract or feces such that a small amount of maker is present to confound subsequent experimental results, and that marker concentration have stabilized when these samples are collected.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundA series of modified montmorillonites (Mt) including zinc-loaded Mt (Zn-Mt), copper-loaded Mt (Cu-Mt), copper/zinc-loaded Mt with different Cu/Zn ratio (Cu/Zn-Mt-1, Cu/Zn-Mt-2, Cu/Zn-Mt-3) were prepared by an ion-exchange reaction, and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The specific surface areas, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the modified Mt were investigated.ResultsIn the modified Mt, hydrated Cu ions and Zn ions were exchanged in the interlayer space of Mt and the particles were irregular shapes. The results showed that Cu/Zn-Mt enhanced antibacterial and antifungal activity compared with Zn-Mt and Cu-Mt possibly due to the synergistic effect between Cu and Zn. Among the Cu/Zn-Mt with different Cu/Zn raitos, Cu/Zn-Mt with a Cu/Zn ratio of 0.98 or 0.51 showed higher antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), fungi (Candida albicans). Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of Cu/Zn-Mt was correlated with its specific surface area. Cytotoxicity studies on IPEC-J2 cell showed a slight cytotoxicity of Cu/Zn-Mt.ConclusionsThe current data provide clear evidence that in terms of its antimicrobial activity and relatively low toxicity, the Cu/Zn-Mt holds great promise for applications in animal husbandry.',\n",
       " 'Nanoparticles have been used as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in the human medical field for quite some time, though their application in veterinary medicine and animal production is still relatively new. Recently, production demands on the livestock industry have been centered around the use of antibiotics as growth promoters due to growing concern over microbial antibiotic resistance. With many countries reporting increased incidences of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, laws and regulations are being updated to end in-feed antibiotic use in the animal production industry. This sets the need for suitable alternatives to be established for inclusion in feed. Many reports have shown evidence that nanoparticles may be good candidates for animal growth promotion and antimicrobials. The current status and advancements of nanotechnological applications in animal production will be the focus of this review and the emerging roles of nanoparticles for nutrient delivery, biocidal agents, and tools in veterinary medicine and reproduction will be discussed.

       " 'Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the role of peptides in animal nutrition. Chemical, enzymatic, or microbial hydrolysis of proteins in animal by-products or plant-source feedstuffs before feeding is an attractive means of generating high-quality small or large peptides that have both nutritional and physiological or regulatory functions in livestock, poultry and fish. These peptides may also be formed from ingested proteins in the gastrointestinal tract, but the types of resultant peptides can vary greatly with the physiological conditions of the animals and the composition of the diets. In the small intestine, large peptides are hydrolyzed to small peptides, which are absorbed into enterocytes faster than free amino acids (AAs) to provide a more balanced pattern of AAs in the blood circulation. Some peptides of plant or animal sources also have antimicrobial, antioxidant, antihypertensive, and immunomodulatory activities. Those peptides which confer biological functions beyond their nutritional value are called bioactive peptides. They are usually 2–20 AA residues in length but may consist of >20 AA residues. Inclusion of some (e.g. 2–8%) animal-protein hydrolysates (e.g., porcine intestine, porcine mucosa, salmon viscera, or poultry tissue hydrolysates) or soybean protein hydrolysates in practical corn- and soybean meal-based diets can ensure desirable rates of growth performance and feed efficiency in weanling pigs, young calves, post-hatching poultry, and fish. Thus, protein hydrolysates hold promise in optimizing the nutrition of domestic and companion animals, as well as their health (particularly gut health) and well-being.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundSperm DNA fragmentation (sDF) has been proved to be an important parameter in order to predict in vitro the potential fertility of a semen sample. Colloid centrifugation could be a suitable technique to select those donkey sperm more resistant to DNA fragmentation after thawing. Previous studies have shown that to elucidate the latent damage of the DNA molecule, sDF should be assessed dynamically, where the rate of fragmentation between treatments indicates how resistant the DNA is to iatrogenic damage. The rate of fragmentation is calculated using the slope of a linear regression equation. However, it has not been studied if sDF dynamics fit this model. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of different after-thawing centrifugation protocols on sperm DNA fragmentation and elucidate the most accurate mathematical model (linear regression, exponential or polynomial) for DNA fragmentation over time in frozen-thawed donkey semen.ResultsAfter submitting post-thaw semen samples to no centrifugation (UDC), sperm washing (SW) or single layer centrifugation (SLC) protocols, sDF values after 6\\xa0h of incubation were significantly lower in SLC samples than in SW or UDC. Coefficient of determination (R2) values were significantly higher for a second order polynomial model than for linear or exponential. The highest values for acceleration of fragmentation (aSDF) were obtained for SW, followed by SLC and UDC.ConclusionSLC after thawing seems to preserve longer DNA longevity in comparison to UDC and SW. Moreover, the fine-tuning of models has shown that sDF dynamics in frozen-thawed donkey semen fit a second order polynomial model, which implies that fragmentation rate is not constant and fragmentation acceleration must be taken into account to elucidate hidden damage in the DNA molecule.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to determine the association of three proteins involved in sperm function on the freezability of porcine semen: the heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90a), the Niemann-Pick disease type C2 protein (NPC2), and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS).Six adult boars (each boar was ejaculated three times, 18 in total) were classified by freezability based on the percentage of functionally competent sperm. The male semen with highest freezability (MHF) and the male semen with lowest freezability (MLF) were centrifuged immediately after collection to separate seminal plasma and spermatozoa to make four possible combinations of these two components and to incubate them for 3\\xa0h, adjusting the temperature to 17\\xa0°C, to freeze them afterwards. The quantification of proteins was performed in two stages: at zero and at 3\\xa0h after incubation of the four combinations.ResultsThe spermatozoa × incubation time (IT) interaction only had effect (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) on HSP90a levels; this protein increased in seminal plasma, after 3\\xa0h of incubation, in larger quantity (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in combinations with MLF spermatozoa. In relation with the NPC2 protein, two isoforms of 16 and 19\\xa0kDa were identified. The 19\\xa0kDa isoform was affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) only by the seminal plasma × IT interaction, with superior values (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) both at zero and three hours of incubation, in the combinations with MHF seminal plasma; and 16\\xa0kDa isoform was affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) only by the IT with reduction after 3\\xa0h of incubation. The levels of L-PGDS was affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) only by the spermatozoa × IT interaction, which reduced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) in combinations with MLF spermatozoa after 3\\xa0h of incubation.ConclusionsIt is possible to consider that the three proteins evaluated were associated with freezability of boar semen due, especially, to the fact that mixtures with MLF spermatozoa showed greater increase levels of the HSP90a protein and reduction of L-PGDS in plasma. In addition, the seminal plasma of MHF had higher concentration of the NPC2 of 19\\xa0kDa protein, which was reduced by incubating with MHF spermatozoa.',\n",
       " 'Dairy cows are customarily given grains and highly digestible byproduct ingredients as additions to forage to support milk production. In many parts of the world growing seasons are short, and the grain crops that can be grown may not provide adequate yields. Sugar beets, on the other hand are relatively hardy, and dry matter yields surpass the yields of most grain crops. There are however, perceptions that beets may not be suitable as a feed ingredient due to the fact that the storage form of carbohydrate is sugar rather than starch. With little analytical support, sugar has been rejected in many feeding programs with the view that sugar reduces rumen pH, fiber digestion and microbial yield. This review explores available facts revolving around these concerns. Information regarding the feeding of sugar beets is provided and the use of sugar beets as a partial replacement for grain is proposed.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe health of chickens and the welfare of poultry industry are central to the efforts of addressing global food security. Therefore, it is essential to study chicken immunology to maintain and improve its health and to find novel and sustainable solutions. This paper presents a study on investigation of the effect of Scutellaria baicalensis root (SBR) on the immune response of broiler chicken, especially on lymphocytes and heterophils reactivity, regarding their contribution to the development of immunity of the chickens.MethodsThe 121-day-old Hubbard Hi-Y male broiler hybrids were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, three SBR supplemented groups (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of SBR) and one control group. Each treatment was replicated five times with six birds per replicate pen in a battery brooder. Blood was collected after 3rd and 6th wk of the experiment, and hemoglobin and hematocrit values were determined, as well as total leukocyte count and differential count were performed. Nitroblue tetrazolium test and phagocytosis assay as nonspecific immune parameters and humoral immune responses to the antigenic challenge by sheep red blood cells were performed. Moreover, the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes to form radial segmentation (RS) of their nuclei was analyzed. Body weight and relative weight of spleen, liver, and bursa of Fabricius were recorded.ResultsResults showed that mean heterophile/lymphocyte ratio increased in the SBR groups compared to the control group and the blood of the chickens showed lymphocytic depletion. The results also demonstrated that the relative weight of bursa of Fabricius and spleen in groups fed with SBR significantly decreased compared to the control group. This study also showed that the addition of SBR significantly inhibited the formation of RS of nuclei compared to some cytotoxic substances.ConclusionWe found that SBR supplementation should be carefully evaluated when given to poultry. The excess intake of SBR supplementation may cause immunologic inhibition and may negatively affect the development of immune organs. SBR has inhibited the formation of radial segmentation nuclei showing antimetastatic properties and also the phagocytosis of chicken heterophils.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundG-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), also referred as Free Fatty Acid Receptors (FFAR), are widely studied within human medicine as drug targets for metabolic disorders. To combat metabolic disorders prevalent in dairy cows during the transition period, which co-occur with negative energy balance and changes to lipid and glucose metabolism, it may be helpful to identify locations and roles of FFAR and other members of the GPCR family in bovine tissues.ResultsQuantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) of subcutaneous adipose, liver, and PMNL samples during the transition period (-10, +7, and +20 or +30 d) were used for expression profiling of medium- (MCFA) and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) receptors GPR120 and GPR40, MCFA receptor GPR84, and niacin receptor HCAR2/3. Adipose samples were obtained from cows with either high (HI; BCS\\u2009≥\\u20093.75) or low (LO; BCS\\u2009≤\\u20093.25) body condition score (BCS) to examine whether FFAR expression is correlated with this indicator of health and body reserves. Supplementation of rumen-protected methionine (MET), which may improve immune function and production postpartum, was also compared with unsupplemented control (CON) cows for liver and blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) samples. In adipose tissue, GPR84 and GPR120 were differentially expressed over time, while GPR40 was not expressed; in PMNL, GPR40 was differentially expressed over time and between MET vs. CON, GPR84 expression differed only between dietary groups, and GPR120 was not expressed; in liver, GPCR were either not expressed or barely detectable.ConclusionsThe data indicate that there is likely not a direct role in liver for the selected GPCR during the transition period, but they do play variable roles in adipose and PMN. In future, these receptors may prove useful targets and/or markers for peripartal metabolism and immunity.',\n",

       " 'BackgroundDuring sperm maturation, there is a reorganization of fatty acids from plasmatic membrane of the spermatozoa, which allows higher membrane integrity and acquisition of sperm motility. However, the fatty acid profile during sperm maturation remains unclear in dogs. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the fatty acids from the epididymal spermatozoa and plasma during the sperm maturation, and observed changes in the motility and plasmatic membrane parameters. Twenty one adult dogs were used, subsequently to bilateral orchiectomy and epididymal storage, sperm samples were collected from the different segments of the epididymis. Samples were evaluated for conventional microscopy, computer-assisted motility analysis, sperm plasma membrane permeability and the fatty acid analysis (lipids were extracted, transmethylated and analyzed by chromatography).ResultsCaput and corpus sperm showed lower values for the motility variables evaluated and plasmatic membrane integrity, indicating different levels of the fatty acids organization. Saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids were in higher concentrations in the spermatozoa from epididymis cauda. Highlighting the presence of caprylic, stearic and docosahexaenoic acids.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the influence of the fatty acid profile during sperm maturation, assigning physical and chemical changes in sperm cells, essential for fertilization.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundFeeding higher-energy prepartum is a common practice in the dairy industry. However, recent data underscore how it could reduce performance, deepen negative energy balance, and augment inflammation and oxidative stress in fresh cows. We tested the effectiveness of rumen-protected methionine in preventing the negative effect of feeding a higher-energy prepartum. Multiparous Holstein cows were fed a control lower-energy diet (CON, 1.24 Mcal/kg DM; high-straw) during the whole dry period (~50 d), or were switched to a higher-energy (OVE, 1.54 Mcal/kg DM), or OVE plus Smartamine M (OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM; Adisseo NA) during the last 21 d before calving. Afterwards cows received the same lactation diet (1.75 Mcal/kg DM). Smartamine M was top-dressed on the OVE diet (0.07% of DM) from -21 through 30 d in milk (DIM). Liver samples were obtained via percutaneous biopsy at -10, 7 and 21 DIM. Expression of genes associated with energy and lipid metabolism, hepatokines, methionine cycle, antioxidant capacity and inflammation was measured.ResultsPostpartal dry matter intake, milk yield, and energy-corrected milk were higher in CON and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with OVE. Furthermore, milk protein and fat percentages were greater in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with CON and OVE. Expression of the gluconeogenic gene PCK1 and the lipid-metabolism transcription regulator PPARA was again greater with CON and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with OVE. Expression of the lipoprotein synthesis enzyme MTTP was lower in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM than CON or OVE. Similarly, the hepatokine FGF21, which correlates with severity of negative energy balance, was increased postpartum only in OVE compared to the other two groups. These results indicate greater liver metabolism and functions to support a greater production in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM. At 7 DIM, the enzyme GSR involved in the synthesis of glutathione tended to be upregulated in OVE than CON-fed cows, suggesting a greater antioxidant demand in overfed cows. Feeding OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM resulted in lower similar expression of GSR compared with CON. Expression of the methionine cycle enzymes SAHH and MTR, both of which help synthesize methionine endogenously, was greater prepartum in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with both CON and OVE, and at 7 DIM for CON and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM compared with OVE, suggesting greater Met availability. It is noteworthy that DNMT3A, which utilizes S-adenosylmethionine generated in the methionine cycle, was greater in OVE and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM indicating higher-energy diets might enhance DNA methylation, thus, Met utilization.ConclusionsData indicate that supplemental Smartamine M was able to compensate for the negative effect of prepartal energy-overfeeding by alleviating the demand for intracellular antioxidants, thus, contributing to the increase in production. Moreover Smartamine M improved hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism, leading to greater liver function and better overall health.',\n",

However, bacterial profiles in rumen original digesta, liquid and solid fractions vary from each other and need to be better established.MethodsTo compare bacterial profiles in each fraction, samples of rumen digesta from six cows fed either a high fiber diet (HFD) or a high energy diet (HED) were collected via rumen fistulas. Rumen digesta was then squeezed through four layers of cheesecloth to separate liquid and solid fractions. The bacterial profiles of rumen original digesta, liquid and solid fractions were analyzed with High-throughput sequencing technique.ResultsRumen bacterial diversity was mainly affected by diet and individual cow (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) rather than rumen fraction. Bias distributed bacteria were observed in solid and liquid fractions of rumen content using Venn diagram and LEfSe analysis. Fifteen out of 16 detected biomarkers (using LEfSe analysis) were found in liquid fraction, and these 15 biomarkers contributed the most to the bacterial differences among rumen content fractions.ConclusionsSimilar results were found when using samples of original rumen digesta, rumen liquid or solid fractions to assess diversity of rumen bacteria; however, more attention should be draw onto bias distributed bacteria in different ruminal fractions, especially when liquid fraction has been used as a representative sample for rumen bacterial study.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn the last years, difficulties occurring in corn cultivation (i.e., groundwater shortages, mycotoxin contamination) have been forcing dairy farmers to consider alternative silages. Some experiments conducted on lactating cows have proven that the total replacement of corn silage with sorghum silage did not reduce milk yield. However, this kind of substitution involves supplementing sorghum-based diets with grains, to compensate for the lower starch content of sorghum silage compared to corn silage. Change of silage type and inclusion of starch sources in the diet would influence rumen fermentations, with possible effects on milk composition (i.e., fatty acid profile) and coagulation properties. A worsening of milk coagulation properties would have a negative economic impact in Italy, where most of the milk produced is processed into cheese.This study was designed to compare milk composition and quality, with emphasis on fatty acid profile and coagulation properties, in dairy cows fed two diets based on corn or sorghum silage.ResultsThe sorghum diet reduced milk yield (P\\u2009=\\u20090.043) but not 4% fat corrected milk (P\\u2009=\\u20090.85). Feeding sorghum silage did not influence milk contents of protein (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07) and lactose (P\\u2009=\\u20090.65), and increased fat content (P\\u2009=\\u20090.024). No differences emerged for milk concentrations of saturated (P\\u2009=\\u20090.61) and monounsaturated fatty acids (P\\u2009=\\u20090.50), whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) for the sorghum diet. Concentrations of n-6 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and n-3 fatty acids (P\\u2009=\\u20090.017) were lower in milk of cows fed the sorghum diet. Milk coagulation properties did not differ between the two diets, except the “a30” (the curd firmness, expressed in mm, 30 min after rennet addition), that was lower (P\\u2009=\\u20090.042) for the sorghum diet.ConclusionsFeeding a forage sorghum silage, properly supplemented with corn meal, as total replacement of corn silage maintained milk composition and did not influence negatively milk coagulation properties, which have a great economic relevance for the Italian dairy industry. Thus, silages obtained from forage sorghums could have a potential as substitute of corn silages in dairy cow diets.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn this experiment, intermittent suckling (IS) with or without the co-mingling (CoM) of piglets was studied as a method to stimulate solid feed intake and reduce post-weaning stress.MethodsThree weaning regimes using 30 multiparous sows were compared: (1) conventional weaning (CW) (n\\u2009=\\u200910 litters), where piglets had continuous access to the sow until weaning (d 0, farrowing\\u2009=\\u2009d −25 relative to weaning); (2) intermittent suckling (IS) (n\\u2009=\\u200910 litters), where piglets were separated from the sow for 8\\xa0h/d starting at d −7 (relative to weaning); and (3) intermittent suckling with co-mingling (ISCo) (n\\u2009=\\u200910 litters) where IS started at d −7 and two litters were housed together during separation and then returned to their original sow. Ad libitum creep feed was available from d −17. At weaning pigs were housed in pens of 11 pigs, 27 pens in total. The ISCo treatment was divided in half to examine effects of different mixing strategies after weaning. Half of the ISCo litters were kept in familiar groups (ISCoF, familiar, n\\u2009=\\u20094) and the other half were mixed within treatment resulting in groups of unfamiliar pigs (ISCoNF, not familiar,\\xa0n\\xa0= 5), the same as IS (n\\u2009=\\u20099) and CW (n\\u2009=\\u20099) treatments.ResultsThe ISCo piglets ate more creep feed in the week before weaning (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), but also showed more aggressive and manipulative behaviour on first day of CoM compared with CW piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). IS with or without CoM increased exploratory and play behaviour on the first day of treatment intervention (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and increased sleeping behaviour on the last day of treatment intervention compared with CW (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Mixing strategy at weaning had an effect on performance data with the highest growth and feed intake seen in ISCoF pigs 2 to 8\\xa0d after weaning (P <0.001). IS and ISCoNF pigs also grew faster and ate more than CW pigs 2 to 8 d after weaning (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Post-weaning injury scores suggested reduced aggression in ISCo as evidenced by reduced redness (skin irritation) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and a tendency for ISCo to have less scratches than CW (P\\u2009<\\u20090.1). The IS pigs slept the most and displayed less manipulative behaviours on the day of weaning and plasma haptoglobin levels remained low in IS pigs after weaning (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.01).ConclusionsBoth intermittent suckling techniques improved production indices in the immediate post-weaning period. However, the addition of co-mingling before weaning in combination with grouping familiar pigs together after weaning improved performance in an additive manner.',\n",
       " 'Methanogenic archaea reside primarily in the rumen and the lower segments of the intestines of ruminants, where they utilize the reducing equivalents derived from rumen fermentation to reduce carbon dioxide, formic acid, or methylamines to methane (CH4). Research on methanogens in the rumen has attracted great interest in the last decade because CH4 emission from ruminants contributes to global greenhouse gas emission and represents a loss of feed energy. Some DNA-based phylogenetic studies have depicted a diverse and dynamic community of methanogens in the rumen. In the past decade, researchers have focused on elucidating the underpinning that determines and affects the diversity, composition, structure, and dynamics of methanogen community of the rumen. Concurrently, many researchers have attempted to develop and evaluate interventions to mitigate enteric CH4 emission. Although much work has been done using plant secondary metabolites, other approaches such as using nitrate and 3-nitrooxy propanol have also yielded promising results. Most of these antimethanogenic compounds or substances often show inconsistent results among studies and also lead to adverse effects on feed intake and digestion and other aspects of rumen fermentation when fed at doses high enough to achieve effective mitigation. This review provides a brief overview of the rumen methanogens and then an appraisal of most of the antimethanogenic compounds and substances that have been evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Knowledge gaps and future research needs are also discussed with a focus on methanogens and methane mitigation.',\n",
       " 'At birth the piglet’s immune system is immature and it is dependent upon passive maternal protection until weaning. The piglet’s mucosal immune system develops over the first few weeks but has not reached maturity at weaning ages which are common on commercial farms. At weaning piglets are presented with a vast and diverse range of microbial and dietary/environmental antigens. Their ability to distinguish between antigens and mount a protective response to potential pathogens and to develop tolerance to dietary antigens is critical to their survival and failure to do so is reflected in the high incidence of morbidity and mortality in the post-weaning period. A growing recognition that the widespread use of antibiotics to control infection during this critical period should be controlled has led to detailed studies of those factors which drive the development of the mucosal immune system, the role of gut microbiota in driving this process, the origin of the bacteria that colonise the young piglet’s intestine and the impact of rearing environment. This review briefly describes how the mucosal immune system is equipped to respond “appropriately” to antigenic challenge and the programmed sequence by which it develops. The results of studies on the critical interplay between the host immune system and gut microbiota are discussed along with the effects of rearing environment. By comparing these with results from human studies on the development of allergies in children, an approach to promote an earlier maturation of the piglet immune system to resist the challenges of weaning are outlined.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAdaptive response includes a variety of physiological modifications to face changes in external or internal conditions and adapt to a new situation. The acute phase proteins (APPs) are reactants synthesized against environmental stimuli like stress, infection, inflammation.MethodsTo delineate the differences in molecular constituents of adaptive response to the environment we performed the whole-blood transcriptome analysis in Italian Holstein (IH) and Italian Simmental (IS) breeds. For this, 663 IH and IS cows from six commercial farms were clustered according to the blood level of APPs. Ten extreme individuals (five APP+ and APP- variants) from each farm were selected for the RNA-seq using the Illumina sequencing technology. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were analyzed using dynamic impact approach (DIA) and DAVID annotation clustering. Milk production data were statistically elaborated to assess the association of APP+ and APP- gene expression patterns with variations in milk parameters.ResultsThe overall de novo assembly of cDNA sequence data generated 13,665 genes expressed in bovine blood cells. Comparative genomic analysis revealed 1,152 DE genes in the comparison of all APP+ vs. all APP- variants; 531 and 217 DE genes specific for IH and IS comparison respectively. In all comparisons overexpressed genes were more represented than underexpressed ones. DAVID analysis revealed 369 DE genes across breeds, 173 and 73 DE genes in IH and IS comparison respectively. Among the most impacted pathways for both breeds were vitamin B6 metabolism, folate biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism.ConclusionsBoth DIA and DAVID approaches produced a high number of significantly impacted genes and pathways with a narrow connection to adaptive response in cows with high level of blood APPs. A similar variation in gene expression and impacted pathways between APP+ and APP- variants was found between two studied breeds. Such similarity was also confirmed by annotation clustering of the DE genes. However, IH breed showed higher and more differentiated impacts compared to IS breed and such particular features in the IH adaptive response could be explained by its higher metabolic activity. Variations of milk production data were significantly associated with APP+ and APP- gene expression patterns.',\n",

BCAA (isoleucine, leucine and valine) regulate many key signaling pathways, the most classic of which is the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. This signaling pathway connects many diverse physiological and metabolic roles. Recent years have witnessed many striking developments in determining the novel functions of BCAA including: (1) Insufficient or excessive levels of BCAA in the diet enhances lipolysis. (2) BCAA, especially isoleucine, play a major role in enhancing glucose consumption and utilization by up-regulating intestinal and muscular glucose transporters. (3) Supplementation of leucine in the diet enhances meat quality in finishing pigs. (4) BCAA are beneficial for mammary health, milk quality and embryo growth. (5) BCAA enhance intestinal development, intestinal amino acid transportation and mucin production. (6) BCAA participate in up-regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, abnormally elevated BCAA levels in the blood (decreased BCAA catabolism) are a good biomarker for the early detection of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases. This review will provide some insights into these novel metabolic and physiological functions of BCAA.',\n",
       " 'Ruminants utilize a wide variety of dietary substrates that are not digestible by the mammals, through microbial fermentation taking place in the rumen. Recent advanced molecular based approaches have allowed the characterization of rumen microbiota and its compositional changes under various treatment conditions. However, the knowledge is still limited on the impacts of variations in the rumen microbiota on host biology and function. This review summarizes the information to date on host-microbial interactions in the rumen and how we can apply such information to seek the opportunities to enhance the animal performance through manipulating the rumen function.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe immense growth in global bioethanol production has greatly increased the supply of by-products such as whole stillage and condensed distiller’s solubles, which could be potentially used for animal feeding.

Inclusion levels of CCDS and CWS for Treatments 1, 2, and 3 were fixed during all the three phases of the experiment. Inclusion levels of CWS and CCDS were on 88% dry matter basis. The liquid feeding system delivered feed from the mixing tank to feed troughs by high-pressure air, had sensors inside feed troughs, and recorded daily feed intake on the basis of a reference feed intake curve. The pigs were fed 5 to 10 times per day with increasing frequency during the experiment.ResultsControl pigs had greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) average daily gain (0.91 vs. 0.84, 0.85, 0.85\\xa0kg/d) and gain to feed ratio (0.37 vs. 0.33, 0.34, 0.34) than pigs in the other three treatments during the overall period. Compared with the control, the other three groups had (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) or tended to have (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) lower carcass weight and backfat depth due to lighter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) slaughter body weight, but similar (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) dressing percentage, loin muscle depth, and lean percentage were observed among the four treatments. Inclusion of CWS and CCDS reduced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) or tended to reduce (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) belly firmness but did not influence (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) the overall like, flavor, tenderness and juiciness of loin chops when compared with the control group.ConclusionIn conclusion, our results indicate that including 30–50% of a mixture of whole stillage and condensed distiller’s solubles in the growing-finishing diets may reduce growth performance, carcass weight and belly firmness, but does not affect pork sensory traits.',\n",
       " 'Methane emissions from ruminant livestock contribute significantly to the large environmental footprint of agriculture. The rumen is the principal source of methane, and certain features of the microbiome are associated with low/high methane phenotypes. Despite their primary role in methanogenesis, the abundance of archaea has only a weak correlation with methane emissions from individual animals. The composition of the archaeal community appears to have a stronger effect, with animals harbouring the Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii clade tending to be associated with greater methane emissions. Ciliate protozoa produce abundant H2, the main substrate for methanogenesis in the rumen, and their removal (defaunation) results in an average 11% lower methane emissions in vivo, but the results are not consistent. Different protozoal genera seem to result in greater methane emissions, though community types (A, AB, B and O) did not differ. Within the bacteria, three different ‘ruminotypes’ have been identified, two of which predispose animals to have lower methane emissions. The two low-methane ruminotypes are generally characterized by less abundant H2-producing bacteria. A lower abundance of Proteobacteria and differences in certain Bacteroidetes and anaerobic fungi seem to be associated with high methane emissions. Rumen anaerobic fungi produce abundant H2 and formate, and their abundance generally corresponds to the level of methane emissions. Thus, microbiome analysis is consistent with known pathways for H2 production and methanogenesis, but not yet in a predictive manner. The production and utilisation of formate by the ruminal microbiota is poorly understood and may be a source of variability between animals.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPrimordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of functional gametes, have distinct characteristics and exhibit several unique molecular mechanisms to maintain pluripotency and germness in comparison to somatic cells. They express germ cell-specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs) by modulating tissue-specific cis- and trans-regulatory elements. Studies on gene structures of chicken vasa homologue (CVH), a chicken RNA binding protein, involved in temporal and spatial regulation are thus important not only for understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate germ cell fate, but also for practical applications of primordial germ cells. However, very limited studies are available on regulatory elements that control germ cell-specific expression in chicken. Therefore, we investigated the intricate regulatory mechanism(s) that governs transcriptional control of CVH.ResultsWe constructed green fluorescence protein (GFP) or luciferase reporter vectors containing the various 5′ flanking regions of CVH gene. From the 5′ deletion and fragmented assays in chicken PGCs, we have identified a CVH promoter that locates at −316 to +275 base pair fragment with the highest luciferase activity. Additionally, we confirmed for the first time that the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) containing intron 1 is required for promoter activity of the CVH gene in chicken PGCs. Furthermore, using a transcription factor binding prediction, transcriptome analysis and siRNA-mediated knockdown, we have identified that a set of transcription factors play a role in the PGC-specific CVH gene expression.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that cis-elements and transcription factors localizing in the 5′ flanking region including the 5′ UTR and an intron are important for transcriptional regulation of the CVH gene in chicken PGCs. Finally, this information will contribute to research studies in areas of reproductive biology, constructing of germ cell-specific synthetic promoter for tracing primordial germ cells as well as understanding the transcriptional regulation for maintaining germness in PGCs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundGrain legumes represent a valuable energy source in pig diets due to their high starch content. The present study was conducted to determine the content and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of starch in different grain legume cultivars for pigs by means of both a polarimetric and enzymatic method for starch determination.MethodsThree experiments were conducted with six barrows each which were fitted with ileal T-cannulas. In total, 18 diets including six different cultivars of faba beans (Vicia faba L.) and peas (Pisum sativum L.), five different cultivars of lupins (Lupinus luteus L., Lupinus angustifolius L.), and one diet with a soybean meal (SBM) were fed.ResultsThe starch content of faba beans and peas was greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) when determined polarimetrically than enzymatically (438 vs. 345\\xa0g/kg dry matter (DM) in faba beans and 509 vs. 390\\xa0g/kg DM in peas, respectively). Considerable lower starch contents were obtained in lupins and SBM, with 82 and 48\\xa0g/kg DM (analyzed polarimetrically) and <1.1 and 3\\xa0g/kg DM (analyzed enzymatically), respectively. Mean values for contents of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in grain legumes ranged from 111 and 79\\xa0g/kg DM in peas to 248 and 207\\xa0g/kg DM in lupins, respectively. Contents of condensed tannins in the colored flowered faba bean cultivars ranged from 2.1 to 7.4\\xa0g/kg DM. The AID of starch was greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in pea than in faba bean cultivars, and using the polarimetric starch determination method resulted in greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) digestibility values than using enzymatic starch analysis (84 vs. 80% in faba beans and 86 vs. 83% in peas). Moreover, AID of starch differed (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) within pea cultivars and starch digestibility in faba beans decreased linearly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) as the content of condensed tannins increased. However, there was no relationship between contents of NDF and ADF and AID of starch in pea and faba bean cultivars.ConclusionBoth contents and AID of starch in grain legumes can vary as influenced by the analytical method used for starch determination. Generally, starch digestibility is greater when measured by polarimetric rather than enzymatic methods.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundBovine mastitis is the most common and costly disease of lactating cattle worldwide. Apart from milk somatic cell count (SCC) and somatic cell score (SCS), serum cytokines such as interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) may also be potential indicators for bovine mastitis. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in bovine IL-17F and IL-17A genes on SCC, SCS and serum cytokines in Chinese Holstein and Inner-Mongolia Sanhe cattle, and to compare the mRNA expression variations of the cows with different genotypes.ResultsA total of 464 lactating cows (337 Holstein and 127 Inner-Mongolia Sanhe cattle) were screened for SNPs identification and the data were analyzed using fixed effects of herd, parity, season and year of calving by general linear model procedure. The results revealed that SNP g.24392436C\\u2009>\\u2009T in IL-17F and SNP g.24345410A\\u2009>\\u2009G in IL-17A showed significant effects on SCC and IL-4 in Holstein (n\\u2009=\\u2009337) and on IL-17 and IL-4 in Sanhe cattle (n\\u2009=\\u2009127). The homozygous GG genotype of SNP g.24345410A\\u2009>\\u2009G had significantly higher mRNA expression compared with the heterozygous AG genotype.ConclusionsThe results indicate that IL-17F and IL-17A could be powerful candidate genes of mastitis resistance and the significant SNPs might be useful genetic markers against mastitis in both dairy and dual purpose cattle.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundMastitis, an infection caused by Gram-positive bacteria, produces udder inflammation and oxidative injury in milk-producing mammals. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is important for host recognition of invading Gram-positive microbes. Over-expression of TLR2 in transgenic dairy goats is a useful model for studying various aspects of infection with Gram-positive bacteria, in vivo.MethodsWe over-expressed TLR2 in transgenic dairy goats. Pam3CSK4, a component of Gram-positive bacteria, triggered the TLR2 signal pathway by stimulating the monocytes-macrophages from the TLR2-positive transgenic goats, and induced over-expression of activator protein-1 (AP-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inflammation factors downstream of the signal pathway.ResultsCompared with wild-type controls, measurements of various oxidative stress-related molecules showed that TLR2, when over-expressed in transgenic goat monocytes-macrophages, resulted in weak lipid damage, high level expression of anti-oxidative stress proteins, and significantly increased mRNA levels of transcription factor NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and the downstream gene, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). When Pam3CSK4 was used to stimulate ear tissue in vivo the HO-1 protein of the transgenic goats had a relatively high expression level.ConclusionsThe results indicate that the oxidative injury in goats over-expressing TLR2 was reduced following Pam3CSK4 stimulation. The underlying mechanism for this reduction was increased expression of the anti-oxidation gene HO-1 by activation of the Nrf2 signal pathway.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPrevious studies suggested that supplementation of lactating sows with β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) could improve the performance of weaning pigs, but there were little information in the muscle fiber type transformation of the offspring and the subsequent performance in pigs from weaning through finishing in response to maternal HMB consumption. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of supplementing lactating sows with HMB on skeletal muscle fiber type transformation and growth of the offspring during d 28 and 180 after birth. A total of 20 sows according to their body weight were divided into the control (CON, n\\u2009=\\u200910) or HMB groups (HMB, n\\u2009=\\u200910). Sows in the HMB group were supplemented with β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate calcium (HMB-Ca) 2\\xa0g /kg feed during d 1 to 27 of lactation. After weaning, 48 mixed sex piglets were blocked by sow treatment and fed standard diets for post-weaning, growing, finishing periods. Growth performance was recorded during d 28 to 180 after birth. Pigs were slaughtered on d 28 (n\\u2009=\\u20096/treatment) and 180 (n\\u2009=\\u20096/treatment) postnatal, and the longissimus dorsi (LD) was collected, respectively.ResultsThe HMB-fed sows during lactation showed increased HMB concentration (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in milk and LD of weaning piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, offsprings in HMB group had a higher finishing BW and lean percentage than did pigs in CON group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), meanwhile, compared with pigs from sows fed the CON diet, pigs from sows fed HMB diet showed higher type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), elevated myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIb and Sox6 mRNA, and fast-MyHC protein levels in LD (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).Conclusion sHMB supplemented to sow diets throughout lactation increases the levels of HMB in maternal milk and skeletal muscle of pigs during d 28 after birth and promotes subsequent performance of pigs between d 28 and 180 of age by enhancing glycolytic muscle fiber transformation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe chicken gastrointestinal tract contains a diverse microbiota whose composition and structure play important roles in gut functionality. In this study, microbial shifts resulting from feed supplementation with Bacillus subtilis CSL2 were evaluated in broilers challenged and unchallenged with Salmonella Gallinarum. To analyse bacterial community composition and functionality, 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed.ResultsThe Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline was used to analyse changes in the faecal microbiota over a 24-h period. A total of 718,204 sequences from broiler chickens were recorded and analysed. At the phylum level, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant bacterial taxa. In Salmonella-infected chickens (SC), Bacteroidetes were more highly abundant compared to control (NC) and Bacillus-treated (BT) chickens. At the genus level, in the NC and BT groups, Lactobacillus was present at high abundance, and the abundance of Turicibacter, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, and Bacteroides increased in SC broilers. Furthermore, taxon-independent analysis showed that the SC and BT groups were compositionally distinct at the end of the 24-h period. Further analysis of functional properties showed that B. subtilis CSL2 administration increased gut-associated energy supply mechanisms (i.e. carbohydrate transport and metabolism) to maintain a stable microbiota and protect gut integrity.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that S. Gallinarum infection and B. subtilis CSL2 supplementation in the diet of broiler chickens influenced the diversity, composition, and functional diversity of the faecal microbiota. Moreover, the findings offer significant insights to understand potential mechanisms of Salmonella infection and the mode of action of probiotics in broiler chickens.',\n",
       " 'In the last five decades, attempts have been made to improve rumen fermentation and host animal nutrition through modulation of rumen microbiota. The goals have been decreasing methane production, partially inhibiting protein degradation to avoid excess release of ammonia, and activation of fiber digestion. The main approach has been the use of dietary supplements. Since growth-promoting antibiotics were banned in European countries in 2006, safer alternatives including plant-derived materials have been explored. Plant oils, their component fatty acids, plant secondary metabolites and other compounds have been studied, and many originate or are abundantly available in Asia as agricultural byproducts. In this review, the potency of selected byproducts in inhibition of methane production and protein degradation, and in stimulation of fiber degradation was described in relation to their modes of action. In particular, cashew and ginkgo byproducts containing alkylphenols to mitigate methane emission and bean husks as a source of functional fiber to boost the number of fiber-degrading bacteria were highlighted. Other byproducts influencing rumen microbiota and fermentation profile were also described. Future application of these feed and additive candidates is very dependent on a sufficient, cost-effective supply and optimal usage in feeding practice.',\n",

Animal model was established by inoculation of HCMV (strain AD-169) or coinoculation with Hepatitis E virus (HEV) into the ligated sacculus rotundus and vermiform appendix in living rabbits. The specimens were collected from animals sacrificed 1 and a half hours after infection.ResultsThe virus was found to be capable of reproducing in these specimens through RT-PCR and Western-blot. Severe inflammation damage was found in HCMV-infected tissue. The viral protein could be detected in high amounts in the mucosal epithelium and lamina propria by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescense. Moreover, there are strong positive signals in lymphocytes, macrophages, and lymphoid follicles. Quantitative statistics indicate that lymphocytes among epithlium cells increased significantly in viral infection groups.ConclusionsThe results showed that HCMV or HEV\\u2009+\\u2009HCMV can efficiently infect in rabbits by vivo ligated intestine loop inoculation. The present study successfully developed an infective model in vivo rabbit ligated intestinal Loop for HCMV pathogenesis study. This rabbit model can be helpful for understanding modulation of the gut immune system with HCMV infection.',\n",
       " 'Antimicrobials are critical to contemporary high-intensity beef production. Many different antimicrobials are approved for beef cattle, and are used judiciously for animal welfare, and controversially, to promote growth and feed efficiency. Antimicrobial administration provides a powerful selective pressure that acts on the microbial community, selecting for resistance gene determinants and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria resident in the bovine flora. The bovine microbiota includes many harmless bacteria, but also opportunistic pathogens that may acquire and propagate resistance genes within the microbial community via horizontal gene transfer. Antimicrobial-resistant bovine pathogens can also complicate the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in beef feedlots, threatening the efficiency of the beef production system. Likewise, the transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes to bovine-associated human pathogens is a potential public health concern. This review outlines current antimicrobial use practices pertaining to beef production, and explores the frequency of antimicrobial resistance in major bovine pathogens. The effect of antimicrobials on the composition of the bovine microbiota is examined, as are the effects on the beef production resistome. Antimicrobial resistance is further explored within the context of the wider beef production continuum, with emphasis on antimicrobial resistance genes in the food chain, and risk to the human population.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundCryopreservation of epididymal spermatozoa is important in cases in which it is not possible to collect semen using normal methods, as the sudden death of an animal or a catastrophic injury. However, the freezing and thawing processes cause stress to spermatozoa, including cold shock, osmotic damage, and ice crystal formation, thereby reducing sperm quality. We assessed the motility (%), motion kinematics, capacitation status, and viability of spermatozoa using computer-assisted sperm analysis and Hoechst 33258/chlortetracycline fluorescence staining. Moreover, we identified proteins associated with cryostress using a proteomic approach and performed western blotting to validate two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) results using two commercial antibodies.ResultsCryopreservation reduced viability (%), motility (%), straight-line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), and capacitated spermatozoa, whereas straightness (STR) and the acrosome reaction increased after cryopreservation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Nine proteins were differentially expressed (two proteins decreased and seven increased) (>3 fold, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) before and after cryopreservation. The proteins differentially expressed following cryopreservation are putatively related to several signaling pathways, including the ephrinR-actin pathway, the ROS metabolism pathway, actin cytoskeleton assembly, actin cytoskeleton regulation, and the guanylate cyclase pathway.ConclusionThe results of the current study provide information on epididymal sperm proteome dynamics and possible protein markers of cryo-stress during cryopreservation. This information will further the basic understanding of cryopreservation and aid future studies aiming to identify the mechanism of cryostress responses.',\n",
       " 'Growing evidence suggests the implication of the gut microbiota in various facets of health and disease. In this review, the focus is put on microbiota-host molecular cross-talk at the gut epithelial level with special emphasis on two defense systems: intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and inducible heat shock proteins (iHSPs). Both IAP and iHSPs are induced by various microbial structural components (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, CpG DNA motifs), metabolites (e.g. n-butyrate) or secreted signal molecules (e.g., toxins, various peptides, polyphosphate). IAP is produced in the small intestine and secreted into the lumen and in the interior milieu. It detoxifies microbial components by dephosphorylation and, therefore, down-regulates microbe-induced inflammation mainly by inhibiting NF-κB pro-inflammatory pathway in enterocytes. IAP gene expression and enzyme activity are influenced by the gut microbiota. Conversely, IAP controls gut microbiota composition both directly, and indirectly though the detoxification of pro-inflammatory free luminal adenosine triphosphate and inflammation inhibition. Inducible HSPs are expressed by gut epithelial cells in proportion to the microbial load along the gastro-intestinal tract. They are also induced by various microbial components, metabolites and secreted molecules. Whether iHSPs contribute to shape the gut microbiota is presently unknown. Both systems display strong anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties that are protective to the gut and the host. Importantly, epithelial gene expressions and protein concentrations of IAP and iHSPs can be stimulated by probiotics, prebiotics and a large variety of dietary components, including macronutrients (protein and amino acids, especially L-glutamine, fat, fiber), and specific minerals (e.g. calcium) and vitamins (e.g. vitamins K1 and K2). Some food components (e.g. lectins, soybean proteins, various polyphenols) may inhibit or disturb these systems. The general cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the microbiota-host epithelial crosstalk and subsequent gut protection through IAP and iHSPs are reviewed along with their nutritional modulation. Special emphasis is also given to the pig, an economically important species and valuable biomedical model.',\n",

Sperm were selected by SU in BSA-TCM 199-H medium. A total of 2,294 fresh sperm and 2,760 from frozen-thawed semen were analyzed after SU or SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP binding. Fresh sperm selected by SU showed acrosome reaction (AR) of 59\\xa0%, the sperm selected by SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP binding increased AR to 91\\xa0%.

Ethanol slightly displays higher oocyte activation than calcium ionophore and ionomicine. Sperm selection with SU\\u2009+\\u2009ZP increased AR/A and AR/D rates in comparison with SU in fresh and frozen-thawed sperm. According to this, in terms of fertilization rates, chemical activation after ICSI increased oocyte PN formation compared to mechanical activation.

The percentage of positive samples for DON ranged from 66.7 to 100\\xa0%. Domestic DDGS and imported DDGS presented the most serious contamination AFB1, ZEN and DON contamination levels of feeds ranged from 61.5 to 100\\xa0%, indicated that serious contamination over the studied 3-year period.ConclusionThe current data provide clear evidence that AFB1, ZEN and DON contamination of feed ingredients and complete feeds in different Province in China is serious and differs over past 3-year. The use of corn, domestic DDGS, imported DDGS and corn germ meal, which may be contaminated with these three mycotoxins, as animal feed may triggered a health risk for animal. Feeds are most contaminated with DON followed by ZEN and AFB1. Mycotoxins contamination in feed ingredients and complete feeds should be monitored routinely in China.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundToasting during the production of rapeseed meal (RSM) decreases ileal crude protein (CP) and amino acid (AA) digestibility. The mechanisms that determine the decrease in digestibility have not been fully elucidated. A high protein quality, low-denatured, RSM was produced and toasted up to 120\\xa0min, with samples taken every 20\\xa0min. The aim of this study was to characterize secondary structure and chemical changes of proteins and glucosinolates occurring during toasting of RSM and the effects on its in vitro CP digestibility.ResultsThe decrease in protein solubility and the increase of intermolecular β-sheets with increasing toasting time were indications of protein aggregation. The contents of NDF and ADIN increased with increasing toasting time. Contents of arginine, lysine and O-methylisourea reactive lysine (OMIU-RL) linearly decreased with increasing toasting time, with a larger decrease of OMIU-RL than lysine. First-order reactions calculated from the measured parameters show that glucosinolates were degraded faster than lysine, OMIU-RL and arginine and that physical changes to proteins seem to occur before chemical changes during toasting. Despite the drastic physical and chemical changes noticed on the proteins, the coefficient of in vitro CP digestibility ranged from 0.776 to 0.750 and there were no effects on the extent of protein hydrolysis after 120\\xa0min. In contrast, the rate of protein hydrolysis linearly decreased with increasing toasting time, which was largely correlated to the decrease in protein solubility, lysine and OMIU-RL observed. Rate of protein hydrolysis was more than 2-fold higher for the untoasted RSM compared to the 120\\xa0min toasted material.ConclusionsIncreasing the toasting time for the production of RSM causes physical and chemical changes to the proteins that decrease the rate of protein hydrolysis. The observed decrease in the rate of protein hydrolysis could impact protein digestion and utilization.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThree experiments were conducted to examine the overall hypothesis that addition of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and cysteamine hydrochloride (CSH) into the diets of young and growing pigs would stimulate the endogenous somatotropic axis to improve growth and performance.ResultsIn Experiment 1, weaner pigs were given either a 5 d dietary supplement of 5\\xa0% MCT (n\\u2009=\\u20098) or a control diet (n\\u2009=\\u20098). MCT increased the plasma concentration of growth hormone (GH; P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and the GH secretagogue, ghrelin (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, the MCT treatment reduced scouring (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), maintained villous height in the small intestine (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and stabilised daily weight gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), compared to the controls. Experiment 2 compared the effects of 4 levels (0, 1, 3 and 6\\xa0%\\xa0v/v) of MCT supplementation in grower-finisher male pigs, of approximately 35\\xa0kg live weight (n\\u2009=\\u200915 per treatment). Blood samples taken after 7\\xa0wk of treatment showed that the MCT supplementation increased circulating ghrelin (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), GH (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and insulin (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Daily weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were not affected by the MCT diets. In Experiment 3, 64 female pigs of approximately 60\\xa0kg live weight were allocated to one of three dietary treatments: control (n\\u2009=\\u200920); 6\\xa0% MCT (n\\u2009=\\u200921); and 70\\xa0mg/kg CSH (n\\u2009=\\u200921). After 3\\xa0wk of supplementation, the MCT treated pigs had a higher plasma concentration of ghrelin compared to the control and CSH pigs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Plasma concentrations of GH and weight were not affected by any of the dietary treatments.ConclusionsEvidence is provided in Experiment 1 to support the use of dietary MCT supplements, perhaps acting via stimulation of somatotropic endocrine pathways, to minimise weaning-associated disorders such as slowing of growth and diarrhoea. In Experiments 2 and 3, although there was no effect on weight gain or feed conversion ratio in either experiment, MCT and CSH increased endocrine components of the somatotropic axis.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundBehavior is an important indicator reflecting the welfare of animals. Manual analysis of video is the most commonly used method to study animal behavior. However, this approach is tedious and depends on a subjective judgment of the analysts. There is an urgent need for automatic identification of individual animals and automatic tracking is a fundamental part of the solution to this problem.ResultsIn this study, an algorithm based on a Hybrid Support Vector Machine (HSVM) was developed for the automated tracking of individual laying hens in a layer group. More than 500\\xa0h of video was conducted with laying hens raised under a floor system by using an experimental platform. The experimental results demonstrated that the HSVM tracker outperformed the Frag (fragment-based tracking method), the TLD (Tracking-Learning-Detection), the PLS (object tracking via partial least squares analysis), the MeanShift Algorithm, and the Particle Filter Algorithm based on their overlap rate and the average overlap rate.ConclusionsThe experimental results indicate that the HSVM tracker achieved better robustness and state-of-the-art performance in its ability to track individual laying hens than the other algorithms tested. It has potential for use in monitoring animal behavior under practical rearing conditions.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundRemoval of the follicular content by ultrasound-guided transvaginal follicle aspiration (TVFA) may fail to induce immediate atresia and loss of function, resulting in the occurrence of residual follicles (RF). The aims of this study were to characterize the blood flow in RF and to determine the effects of the treatment with estradiol benzoate on RF fate. Lactating, cyclic Holstein-Gir crossbred cows were used. In Experiment 1, follicular wave emergence (D0) was synchronized in cows (n\\u2009=\\u200910) and follicular growth was then monitored by transrectal ultrasonography from D0 to D8, followed by TVFA of the largest follicle present on the ovaries 24\\xa0h later. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging was used to examine blood flow on the follicular wall, which was recorded immediately before and every 12\\xa0h after TVFA, up to 72\\xa0h. In experiment 2, cows (n\\u2009=\\u200922) were randomly allocated to receive either 2\\xa0mL of saline i.m. (Control group, n\\u2009=\\u200911) or 2\\xa0mL estradiol benzoate i.m. (EB group, n\\u2009=\\u200911) immediately after TVFA. Ovaries were scanned every 12\\xa0h to confirm the presence and to measure the diameter of RF. The contents of the RF, if present, were collected 72\\xa0h after the first TVFA, using the same aspiration procedures. Follicular fluid from original follicles and RF were stored at -20\\xa0°C until hormonal assays.ResultsIn Experiment 1, there was no reduction (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) of blood flow in the remaining follicle walls after TVFA and maximum blood flow values were observed at 49.5\\u2009±\\u200919.7\\xa0h post-TVFA. In Experiment 2, formation of RF after TVFA was proportionally similar between Controls (5/9) and EB (5/10) cows. Also, RF diameter did not differ between groups (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Nonetheless, the content of RF from cows in the EB group had lower (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0004) estradiol (E2) concentration and lower (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0005) E2:P4 ratio compared with Controls.ConclusionsIn conclusion, 1) the persistence of vascularization in the remaining follicle wall may contribute to the formation of RF after follicle aspiration, and 2) the treatment with estradiol benzoate does not prevent formation of RF, but does reduce their estradiol production.',\n",

The pigs were experimentally infected with an enterotoxigenic strain of E. coli and were allocated to a 2\\u2009×\\u20093 factorial design with the respective factors being without and with 125 ppm ASA and three levels of Vit E supplementation (50, 100 or 200\\xa0IU/kg diet, dl-α-tocopheryl acetate).ResultsAcetylsalicylic acid supplementation improved average daily gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and tended to improve feed:gain ratio (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) during the first 14 d after weaning. Acetylsalicylic acid supplementation also improved (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) amino acid utilization efficiency (as assessed by plasma urea level) and tended to decrease (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) PGE2 production in the liver without affecting small intestinal histology and tight junction protein mRNA expression in the jejunal epithelium. Vitamin E supplementation greater than 100\\xa0IU/kg diet sustained both the plasma Vit E concentration (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and plasma haptoglobin content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) after weaning. However, there was no additive effects of the combined supplementation of ASA and Vit E on performance, intestinal barrier function and inflammatory responses of weaned pigs.ConclusionsAlthough ASA and vitamin E improved amino acid utilization efficiency and reduced acute inflammatory responses, ASA and vitamin E did not additively reduce production of PGE2 and inflammatory responses in weaner pigs experimentally infected with an enterotoxigenic strain of E. coli.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundHeat stress is known to alter follicular dynamics and granulosa cell function and may contribute to the diminished reproductive efficiency commonly observed in mammals during the summer. Although several investigators have studied heat-induced ovarian injury, few reports have focused on the effects of chronic heat stress on ovarian function and the molecular mechanisms through which it induces ovarian injury.MethodsIn Exp. 1, 48 female mice were assigned to a control or heat-stressed treatment. After exposure to a constant temperature of 25\\xa0°C for 7, 14, 21 or 28 d (n\\u2009=\\u20096) or to 42\\xa0°C for 3\\xa0h per d for 7, 14, 21 or 28 d (n\\u2009=\\u20096), the mice were euthanized and their ovaries were analyzed for follicular atresia, granulosa cell apoptosis, changes in the abundance of HSP70 protein and serum concentrations of estradiol. In Exp. 2, the expression of HSP70 and aromatase was quantified in antral follicles cultured in vitro at 37 or 42\\xa0°C for 24\\xa0h. In Exp. 3, granulosa cells from ovaries maintained at 37 or 41\\xa0°C for 2\\xa0h were analyzed for their expression of HSP70, Bim, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3.ResultsIn Exp. 1, body weight and food intake of heat-stressed mice decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared with control mice while the concentration of estradiol in serum was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in heat-stressed mice than in control mice. Compared with control mice, the percentage of atretic follicles and the number of antral follicles with severe apoptotic signals were increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) after 21\\xa0d of heat-stressed treatment. HSP70 protein was more abundant (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in heat-stressed mice than control mice. In Exp. 2, heat stress increased HSP70 and decreased aromatase proteins (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in antral follicles. In Exp. 3, TUNEL-positive granulosa cells from heat-stressed ovaries were observed concomitant with a significant increase in HSP70, Bim and cleaved caspase-3 protein.ConclusionHeat-stress in mice decrease estradiol in serum and aromatase in antral follicles but increased number of atretic follicles and granulosa cell undergoing apoptosis which may explain the decreased fertility commonly observed in heat-stressed animals.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundBasal ileal endogenous amino acid (AA) losses (IAAend) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) values of cereal grains, such as barley, are apparently underestimated when determined according to the nitrogen (N)-free method. Regression analysis between the dietary apparent ileal digestible content (cAID) and total crude protein (CP) and AA can be considered as alternative approach to obtain more accurate values for IAAend and SID of AA in cereal grains.MethodsEight hulled barley genotypes were used, with barley being the only source of CP and AA in the assay diets. The diets contained 95\\xa0% as-fed of these eight barley genotypes each, ranging in CP content between 109.1 and 123.8\\xa0g/kg dry matter (DM). Nine ileally T-cannulated barrows, average body weight (BW) 30\\u2009±\\u20092\\xa0kg, were allotted to a row-column design comprising eight periods with 6 d each and nine pigs. On d 5 and the night of d 6 of every period, ileal digesta were collected for a total of 12\\xa0h. The IAAend and the SID were determined by linear regression analysis between cAID and total dietary CP and AA.ResultsThere exist linear relationships between cAID and total CP and AA (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The IAAend of CP, Lys, Met, Thr and Trp amounted to 35.34, 1.08, 0.25, 1.02 and 0.38\\xa0g/kg DM intake (DMI), respectively, which are greater compared to average IAAend determined previously under N-free feeding conditions. The SID of CP, Lys, Met, Thr and Trp was 90, 79, 85, 79 and 86\\xa0%, respectively, and was greater when compared to tabulated values. Moreover, these SID values were greater than those reported in literature, based on correction of apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of CP and AA for their IAAend values. Summarized, the results of the present regression analysis indicate greater IAAend in barley-based diets compared to those obtained by N-free feeding.ConclusionsFor low-protein feed ingredients like barley the regression method may be preferred over correction of AID values for their IAAend determined under N-free feeding conditions, as intercepts and slopes of the linear regression equations between cAID and total dietary CP and AA provide direct estimates of IAAend and SID of CP and AA in the presence of the assay feed ingredient.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe present work investigated the influence of lignin content and composition in the fungal treatment of lignocellulosic biomass in order to improve rumen degradability. Wheat straw and wood chips, differing in lignin composition, were treated with Lentinula edodes for 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 wk and the changes occurring during fungal degradation were analyzed using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and detergent fiber analysis.ResultsL. edodes preferentially degraded lignin, with only limited cellulose degradation, in wheat straw and wood chips, leaving a substrate enriched in cellulose. Syringyl (S)-lignin units were preferentially degraded than guaiacyl (G)-lignin units, resulting in a decreased S/G ratio. A decreasing S/G ratio (wheat straw: r\\u2009=\\u2009−0.72, wood chips: r\\u2009=\\u2009−0.75) and selective lignin degradation (wheat straw: r\\u2009=\\u2009−0.69, wood chips: r\\u2009=\\u2009−0.88) were correlated with in vitro gas production (IVGP), a good indicator for rumen degradability.ConclusionsL. edodes treatment increased the IVGP of wheat straw and wood chips. Effects on IVGP were similar for wheat straw and wood chips indicating that lignin content and 3D-structure of cell walls influence in vitro rumen degradability more than lignin composition.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundModification of chemical composition of diets fed to dairy cows might be a good strategy to reduce methane (CH4) production in the rumen. Notable reductions of CH4 production compared to conventional high-roughages rations were more frequently observed for very concentrated diets or when fat supplements were used. In these cases, the reduction in the gas emission was mainly a consequence of an overall impairment of rumen function with a reduction of fiber digestibility. These strategies do not always comply with feeding standards used in intensive dairy farms and they are usually not applied owing to the risks of negative health and economic consequences.Thus, the present study evaluated the effects of seven commercial diets with contents of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), protein and lipids ranging 325 to 435\\xa0g/kg DM, 115 to 194\\xa0g/kg DM, and 26 to 61\\xa0g/kg DM, respectively, on in vitro degradability, gas (GP), and CH4 production.ResultsIn this experiment, changes in the dietary content of NDF, crude protein (CP) and lipids were always obtained at the expense or in favor of starch. A decreased of the dietary NDF content increased NDF (NDFd) and true DM (TDMd) degradability, and increased CH4 production per g of incubated DM (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), but not that per g of TDMd. An increase of the dietary CP level did not change in vitro NDFd and TDMd, decreased GP per g of incubated DM (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), but CH4 production per g of TDMd was not affected. An increased dietary lipid content reduced NDFd, TDMd, and GP per g of incubated DM, but it had no consequence on CH4 production per g of TDMd.ConclusionsIt was concluded that, under commercial conditions, changes in dietary composition would produce small or negligible alterations of CH4 production per unit of TDMd, but greater differences in GP and CH4 production would be expected when these amounts are expressed per unit of DM intake. The use of TDMd as a standardizing parameter is proposed to account for possible difference in DM intake and productivity.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary restriction and subsequent compensatory growth on the relative expression of genes involved in volatile fatty acid transport, metabolism and cell proliferation in ruminal epithelial tissue of beef cattle. Sixty Holstein Friesian bulls (mean liveweight 370 ± 35\\xa0kg; mean age 479 ± 15 d) were assigned to one of two groups: (i) restricted feed allowance (RES; n\\u2009=\\u200930) for 125\\xa0d (Period 1) followed by ad libitum access to feed for 55\\xa0d (Period 2) or (ii) ad libitum access to feed throughout (ADLIB; n\\u2009=\\u200930). Target growth rate for RES was 0.6\\xa0kg/d during Period 1. At the end of each dietary period, 15 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered and ruminal epithelial tissue and liquid digesta harvested from the ventral sac of the rumen. Real-time qPCR was used to quantify mRNA transcripts of 26 genes associated with ruminal epithelial function. Volatile fatty acid analysis of rumen fluid from individual animals was conducted using gas chromatography.ResultsDiet × period interactions were evident for genes involved in ketogenesis (BDH2, P\\u2009=\\u20090.017), pyruvate metabolism (LDHa, P\\u2009=\\u20090.048; PDHA1, P\\u2009=\\u20090.015) and cellular transport and structure (DSG1, P\\u2009=\\u20090.019; CACT, P\\u2009=\\u20090.027). Ruminal concentrations of propionic acid (P\\u2009=\\u20090.018) and n-valeric acid (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029) were lower in RES animals, compared with ADLIB, throughout the experiment. There was also a strong tendency (P\\u2009=\\u20090.064) toward a diet × period interaction for n-butyric with higher concentrations in RES animals, compared with ADLIB, during Period 1.ConclusionsThese data suggest that following nutrient restriction, the structural integrity of the rumen wall is compromised and there is upregulation of genes involved in the production of ketone bodies and breakdown of pyruvate for cellular energy. These results provide an insight into the potential molecular mechanisms regulating ruminal epithelial absorptive metabolism and growth following nutrient restriction and subsequent compensatory growth.',\n",

A negative correlation (−0.99, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) was observed between α-helix or amide I to starch area ratio and dry matter. A positive correlation (0.99, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) was found between protein β-sheet and crude protein.ConclusionThe results reveal that oat grains are more sensitive to microwave irradiation than dry heating in terms of protein and starch molecular profile and nutrient availability in ruminants.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe overall breeding objective for a nucleus swine selection program is to improve crossbred commercial performance. Most genetic improvement programs are based on an assumed high degree of positive relationship between purebred performance in a nucleus herd and their relatives’ crossbred performance in a commercial herd. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between purebred and crossbred sow longevity performance. Sow longevity was defined as a binary trait with a success occurring if a sow remained in the herd for a certain number of parities and including the cumulative number born alive as a measure of reproductive success. Heritabilities, genetic correlations, and phenotypic correlations were estimated using THRGIBBS1F90.ResultsResults indicated little to no genetic correlations between crossbred and purebred reproductive traits. This indicates that selection for longevity or lifetime performance at the nucleus level may not result in improved longevity and lifetime performance at the crossbred level. Early parity performance was highly correlated with lifetime performance indicating that an indicator trait at an early parity could be used to predict lifetime performance. This would allow a sow to have her own record for the selection trait before she has been removed from the herd.ConclusionsResults from this study aid in quantifying the relationship between purebred and crossbred performance and provide information for genetic companies to consider when developing a selection program where the objective is to improve crossbred sow performance. Utilizing crossbred records in a selection program would be the best way to improve crossbred sow productivity.',\n",

       " 'BackgroundTo investigate the effects of dietary crude protein (CP) restriction on muscle fiber characteristics and key regulators related to protein deposition in skeletal muscle, a total of 18 growing-finishing pigs (62.30\\u2009±\\u20090.88\\xa0kg) were allotted to 3 groups and fed with the recommended adequate protein (AP, 16 % CP) diet, moderately restricted protein (MP, 13 % CP) diet and low protein (LP, 10 % CP) diet, respectively. The skeletal muscle of different locations in pigs, including longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM), psoas major muscle (PMM) and biceps femoris muscle (BFM) were collected and analyzed.ResultsResults showed that growing-finishing pigs fed the MP or AP diet improved (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) the average daily gain and feed: gain ratio compared with those fed the LP diet, and the MP diet tended to increase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) the weight of LDM. Moreover, the ATP content and energy charge value were varied among muscle samples from different locations of pigs fed the reduced protein diets. We also observed that pigs fed the MP diet up-regulated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) muscular mRNA expression of all the selected key genes, except that myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIb, MyHC IIx, while mRNA expression of ubiquitin ligases genes was not affected by dietary CP level. Additionally, the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway was stimulated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in skeletal muscle of the pigs fed the MP or AP diet compared with those fed the LP diet.ConclusionThe results suggest that the pigs fed the MP diet could catch up to the growth performance and the LDM weight of the pigs fed the AP diet, and the underlying mechanism may be partly due to the alteration in energy status, modulation of muscle fiber characteristics and mTORC1 activation as well as its downstream effectors in skeletal muscle of different locations in growing-finishing pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundTo determine responses of neonatal intestine to maternal increased consumption of DL-methionine (DLM) or DL-2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid (HMTBA), eighteen primiparous sows (Landrace\\u2009×\\u2009Yorkshire) were allocated based on body weight and backfat thickness to the control, DLM and HMTBA groups (n\\u2009=\\u20096), with the nutritional treatments introduced from postpartum d0 to d14.ResultsThe DLM-fed sows showed negative energy balance manifested by lost bodyweight, lower plasma glucose, subdued tricarboxylic acid cycle, and increased plasma lipid metabolites levels. Both villus height and ratio of villus height to crypt depth averaged across the small intestine of piglets were higher in the DLM and HMTBA groups than in the control group. Piglet jejunal oxidized glutathione concentration and ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione were lower in the HMTBA group than in the DLM and control groups. However, piglet jejunal aminopeptidase A, carnitine transporter 2 and IGF-II precursor mRNA abundances were higher in the DLM group than in the HMTBA and control groups.ConclusionIncreasing maternal consumption of methionine as DLM and HMTBA promoted neonatal intestinal growth by increasing morphological development or up-regulating expression of genes responsible for nutrient metabolism. And increasing maternal consumption of HMTBA promoted neonatal intestinal antioxidant capacity without compromising maternal energy homeostasis during early lactation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe ability of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) content of corn fed to growing pigs was tested. One hundred and seventeen corn samples, comprising different planting regions and varieties were collected from all over China in a three-year period. The samples were randomly split into a calibration set (n\\u2009=\\u200988) and a validation set (n\\u2009=\\u200929). The actual and calculated DE and ME content of the corn samples was determined by digestion-metabolism experiments and the prediction equations of Noblet and Perez (J Anim Sci. 71:3389–98,1993). The samples were then subjected to NIRS scanning and calibrations were performed by the modified partial least square (MPLS) regression method based on 77 different spectral pre-treatments. The NIRS equations based on the actually determined and calculated DE and ME were built separately and then validated using validation samples.ResultsThe NIRS equations obtained from actually determined DE, the coefficient of determination for calibration (RSQcal), cross-validation (R2CV), and validation (RSQv) were 0.89, 0.87 and 0.86, and these values for determined ME were 0.87, 0.86 and 0.86. For the NIRS equations built from calculated DE, the RSQcal, R2CV, and RSQv values were 0.88, 0.85 and 0.84, and these values for calculated ME were 0.86, 0.84 and 0.82. Except for the equation based on calculated ME (RPDv\\u2009=\\u20092.38, < 2.50), the other three equations built from actually determined energy and calculated DE produced good prediction performance (RPDv ranging from 2.53 to 2.69, > 2.50) when applied to validation samples.ConclusionThese results indicate that NIRS can be used as a quantitative method for the rapid determination of the available energy in corn fed to growing pigs, and the NIRS equations based on the actually determined energy produced better predictive performance than those built from calculated energy values.',\n",

The expression of 15 lipogenic genes and 7 miRNA were evaluated. Responses to LT2.1, LT1.3, LH3.0, and LV1.6 relative to the control (OPAARMC) included up-regulated expression of ACSS2, FABP3, ACACA, FASN, SCD, LPIN1, INSIG1, SREBF1, PPARD, and NR1H3 (commonly known as LXR-α). Furthermore, LV1.6 up-regulated expression of ACSL1, DGAT1, and RXRA and down-regulated PPARG expression. Although no effect of OPAA on expression of PPARG was observed, compared with the control, OPAA up-regulated expression of the PPAR targets ACSS2, FABP3, ACACA, FASN, SCD, LPIN1, INSIG1, and SREBF1. Compared with the control, the expression of the anti-lipogenic MIR27AB was down-regulated by OPAA, LT2.1, LT1.3 and LH3.0. In contrast, compared with the control, the expression of the pro-lipogenic MIR21 was up-regulated by LT2.1, LT1.3, LH3.0, and LV1.6.ConclusionsThe observed up-regulation of lipogenic gene networks and the changes in expression of key miRNA involved in the control of lipogenic balance are indicative of a potentially important role of EAA ratios and mTOR signaling in the regulation of milk fat synthesis.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAlthough isoflavones are natural dietary antioxidants, they may have toxicological effects. This study aimed to evaluate the redox system in tissues of finishing pigs by supplementation with high dose of daidzein (640 mg/kg).ResultsThe supplementation of high dose of daidzein for 64 d increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity in longissimus muscle but down-regulated the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase-2 and cyclooxygenase-2. In contrast, high-level supplementation with daidzein exerted pro-oxidant changes in back fat, abdominal fat, liver, and plasma, as reflected by increased contents of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, in these tissues. Furthermore, daidzein supplementation resulted in higher expression of ROS-producing enzymes, including NADPH oxidase-1 and cyclooxygenase-1 in liver, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in backfat and NADPH oxidase-2 both in abdominal fat and backfat. The supplementation of daidzein did not affect meat quality parameters in longissimus muscle, including marbling score, eye muscle areas, intramuscular fat, shear force, drip loss, pH and meat color.ConclusionsThis experiment suggests that dietary supplementation of finishing pigs with daidzein at a high dose level improves redox status in muscle but exerts pro-oxidant effect in liver and fat tissues.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe objective of this study was to characterize the mRNA expression profile related to rumen epithelial inflammation through the in vivo and in vitro experiments. In the in vivo experiment, rumen papillae were collected from four dairy cows adapted to either a 40\\xa0% (LC) or 70\\xa0% (HC) concentrate feeds for microarray analysis.ResultsResults showed that 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in the cows fed the HC relative to the LC diet. The DEGs were first annotated, and results revealed that the expression of inflammation-related genes, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-22, CCL19, CCL8, CX3CR1, CXCL6, INHBE, LEPR, PRL, and TNFRSF9 found in the cytokine-cytokine receptor pathway were up-regulated in the HC-fed cows, indicating local inflammation in the rumen epithelium was triggered. The expression of IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-6 was further validated by qRT-PCR. To demonstrate whether there were relationships between cytokine mRNA expression and ruminal factors (pH and LPS), the isolated ruminal epithelial cells were cultured in vitro. Results showed that the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8 increased after the LPS treatment, while low-pH treatment elevated the mRNA expression of TNF-α, suggesting that low-pH coupled with higher levels of LPS in rumen of cows fed the HC may be mainly responsible for the triggered local ruminal inflammation.ConclusionsOur results indicate that ruminal local inflammation response might be triggered during HC feeding, and these findings also enhance the knowledge of rumen epithelial adaptation to HC at the molecular level.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundCalcium is a vital mineral and an indispensable component of milk for ruminants. The regulation of transcellular calcium transport by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3, the active form of vitamin D) has been confirmed in humans and rodents, and regulators, including vitamin D receptor (VDR), calcium binding protein D9k (calbindin-D9k), plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1b (PMCA1b), PMAC2b and Orai1, are involved in this process. However, it is still unclear whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 could stimulate calcium transport in the ruminant mammary gland. The present trials were conducted to study the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 supplementation and energy availability on the expression of genes and proteins related to calcium secretion in goat mammary epithelial cells.MethodsAn in vitro culture method for goat secreting mammary epithelial cells was successfully established. The cells were treated with different doses of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (0, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0\\xa0nmol/L) for calcium transport research, followed by a 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA, an inhibitor of glucose metabolism) treatment to determine its dependence on glucose availability. Cell proliferation ratios, glucose consumption and enzyme activities were measured with commercial kits, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blots were used to determine the expression of genes and proteins associated with mammary calcium transport in dairy goats, respectively.Results1,25-(OH)2D3 promoted cell proliferation and the expression of genes involved in calcium transport in a dose-dependent manner when the concentration did not exceed 10.0\\xa0nmol/L. In addition, 100.0\\xa0nmol/L 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of associated genes compared with the 10.0\\xa0nmol/L treatment. The inhibition of hexokinase 2 (HK2), a rate-limiting enzyme in glucose metabolism, decreased the expression of PMCA1b and PMCA2b at the mRNA and protein levels as well as the transcription of Orai1, indicating that glucose availability was required for goat mammary calcium transport. The optimal concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 that facilitated calcium transport in this study was 10.0\\xa0nmol/L.ConclusionsSupplementation with 1,25-(OH)2D3 influenced cell proliferation and regulated the expression of calcium transport modulators in a dose- and energy-dependent manner, thereby highlighting the role of 1,25-(OH)2D3 as an efficacious regulatory agent that produces calcium-enriched milk in ruminants when a suitable energy status was guaranteed.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundInsulin-like factor 2 (IGF2) plays an important role in embryonic growth process by modulating intermediary metabolism and cell proliferation. Folic acid is involved in one carbon metabolism and contributes to DNA methylation which is related to gene expression. The purpose of this study was to explore whether folic acid could regulate IGF2 expression via epigenetic mechanism and further promote embryonic growth of new-hatched broilers.MethodsIn the present study, 360 fertile eggs were selected and randomly assigned to four treatments. On 11 embryonic day of incubation (E11), 0, 50, 100 and 150\\xa0μg folic acid were injected into eggs respectively. After hatched, growth performance of broilers were calculated. Hepatic IGF2 expression, methylation level and chromatin structure of promoter region were analyzed.ResultsResults have showed that IGF2 expression was up-regulated in 150\\xa0μg folic acid group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and other two dose of folic acid did not affect gene expression (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Meanwhile, methylation level of IGF2 promoter were lower in 100 and 150\\xa0μg groups, which was consistent with lower expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). What’s more, chromatin looseness of IGF2 promoter was higher in 150\\xa0μg group than control group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Further, birth weight (BW), liver and bursa index of new-hatched chickens in 150\\xa0μg folic acid group were higher than the other groups (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). There were positive correlations between hepatic IGF2 expression and BW and organs index (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionIn conclusion, our data have demonstrated that 150\\xa0μg folic acid injection on E11 could up-regulate IGF2 expression by modulating DNA hypomethylation and improving chromatin accessibility in the gene promoter region, and ulteriorly facilitate embryonic growth and organ development of broilers.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe aim of this study was to optimize the fungal treatment of lignocellulosic biomass by stimulating the colonization. Wheat straw and wood chips were treated with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Lentinula edodes with various amounts of colonized millet grains (0.5, 1.5 or 3.0 % per g of wet weight of substrate) added to the substrates. Also, wheat straw and wood chips were chopped to either 0.5 or 2 cm. Effectiveness of the fungal treatment after 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 wk of incubation was determined by changes in chemical composition, in vitro gas production (IVGP) as a measure for rumen degradability, and ergosterol content as a measure of fungal biomass.ResultsIncomplete colonization was observed for C. subvermispora treated wheat straw and L. edodes treated wood chips. The different particle sizes and amounts of inoculum tested, had no significant effects on the chemical composition and the IVGP of C. subvermispora treated wood chips. Particle size did influence L. edodes treatment of wheat straw. The L. edodes treatment of 2 cm wheat straw resulted in a more selective delignification and a higher IVGP than the smaller particles. Addition of 1.5 % or 3 % L. edodes inoculum to wheat straw resulted in more selective delignification and a higher IVGP than addition of 0.5 % inoculum.ConclusionParticle size and amount of inoculum did not have an effect on C. subvermispora treatment of wood chips. At least 1.5 % L. edodes colonized millet grains should be added to 2 cm wheat straw to result in an increased IVGP and acid detergent lignin (ADL) degradation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundBrucella is a zoonotic Gram-negative pathogen that causes abortion and infertility in ruminants and humans. TLR4 is the receptor for LPS which can recognize Brucella and initiate antigen-presenting cell activities that affect both innate and adaptive immunity. Consequently, transgenic sheep over-expressing TLR4 are an suitable model to investigate the effects of TLR4 on preventing Brucellosis. In this study, we generated transgenic sheep overexpressing TLR4 and aimed to evaluate the effects of different seasons (breeding and non-breeding season) on superovulation and the imported exogenous gene on growth.ResultsIn total of 43 donor ewes and 166 recipient ewes in breeding season, 37 donor ewes and 144 recipient ewes in non-breeding season were selected for super-ovulation and injected embryo transfer to generate transgenic sheep. Our results indicated the no. of embryos recovered of donors and the rate of pronuclear embryos did not show any significant difference between breeding and non-breeding seasons (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). The positive rate of exogenous TLR4 tested were 21.21 % and 22.58 % in breeding and non-breeding season by Southern blot. The expression level of TLR4 in the transgenic sheep was 1.5 times higher than in the non-transgenic group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The lambs overexpressing TLR4 had similar growth performance with non-transgenic lambs, and the blood physiological parameters of transgenic and non-transgenic were both in the normal range and did not show any difference.ConclusionsHere we establish an efficient platform for the production of transgenic sheep by the microinjection of pronuclear embryos during the whole year. The over-expression of TLR4 had no adverse effect on the growth of the sheep.',\n",
       " 'Heat as a stressor of poultry has been studied extensively for many decades; it affects poultry production on a worldwide basis and has significant impact on well-being and production. More recently, the involvement of heat stress in inducing oxidative stress has received much interest. Oxidative stress is defined as the presence of reactive species in excess of the available antioxidant capacity of animal cells. Reactive species can modify several biologically cellular macromolecules and can interfere with cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, during the last decade, there has been an ever-increasing interest in the use of a wide array of natural feed-delivered phytochemicals that have potential antioxidant properties for poultry. In light of this, the current review aims to (1) summarize the mechanisms through which heat stress triggers excessive superoxide radical production in the mitochondrion and progresses into oxidative stress, (2) illustrate that this pathophysiology is dependent on the intensity and duration of heat stress, (3) present different nutritional strategies for mitigation of mitochondrial dysfunction, with particular focus on antioxidant phytochemicals.Oxidative stress that occurs with heat exposure can be manifest in all parts of the body; however, mitochondrial dysfunction underlies oxidative stress. In the initial phase of acute heat stress, mitochondrial substrate oxidation and electron transport chain activity are increased resulting in excessive superoxide production. During the later stage of acute heat stress, down-regulation of avian uncoupling protein worsens the oxidative stress situation causing mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue damage. Typically, antioxidant enzyme activities are upregulated. Chronic heat stress, however, leads to downsizing of mitochondrial metabolic oxidative capacity, up-regulation of avian uncoupling protein, a clear alteration in the pattern of antioxidant enzyme activities, and depletion of antioxidant reserves.Some phytochemicals, such as various types of flavonoids and related compounds, were shown to be beneficial in chronic heat-stressed poultry, but were less or not effective in non-heat-stressed counterparts. This supports the contention that antioxidant phytochemicals have potential under challenging conditions. Though substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the association between heat stress and oxidative stress, the means by which phytochemicals can alleviate oxidative stress have been sparsely explored.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundDuring processing in a desolventizer/toaster (DT), rapeseed meal (RSM) is heated to evaporate the hexane and to reduce the level of heat-labile anti-nutritional factors such as glucosinolates (GSL). However, excessive heat treatment may reduce amino acid (AA) content in addition to lower AA digestibility and availability in RSM. The objective of the present study was to produce from one batch of a 00-rapeseed variety (17\\xa0μmol GSL/g dry matter (DM), seed grade quality) five differently processed RSM under standardized and defined conditions in a pilot plant, and to determine the impact of these different treatments on protein solubility and chemical composition, in particular with regard to contents of AA including reactive Lys (rLys) and levels of total and individual GSL.MethodsFour RSM were exposed to wet toasting conditions (WetTC) with increasing residence time in the DT of 48, 64, 76, and 93\\xa0min. A blend of these four RSM was further processed, starting with saturated steam processing (< 100\\xa0°C) and followed by exposure to dry toasting conditions (DryTC) to further reduce the GSL content in this RSM.ResultsThe contents of neutral detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber bound crude protein (CP) increased linearly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), as residence time of RSM in the DT increased from 48 to 93\\xa0min, whereas contents of total and most individual GSL and those of Lys, rLys, Cys, and the calculated ratio of Lys:CP and rLys:CP decreased linearly (P ≤ 0.05). The combination of wet heating and DryTC resulted in the lowest GSL content compared to RSM produced under WetTC, but was associated with lowest protein solubility.ConclusionsIt can be concluded that by increasing residence time in the DT or using alternative processing conditions such as wet heating combined with DryTC, contents of total and individual GSL in RSM can be substantially reduced. Further in vivo studies are warranted to elucidate if and to which extent the observed differences in protein quality and GSL content between RSM may affect digestibility and bioavailability of AA in monogastric animals.',\n",
       " 'Effects of some methodological factors on in vitro measures of gas production (GP, mL/g DM), CH4 production (mL/g DM) and proportion (% CH4 on total GP) were investigated by meta-analysis.

The NDF content of feed sample incubated (NDF) was considered as a continuous variable. From an initial database of 105 papers, 58 were discarded because one of the above-mentioned factors was not stated. After discarding 17 papers, the final dataset comprised 30 papers (339 observations). A preliminary mixed model analysis was carried out on experimental data considering the study as random factor. Variables adjusted for study effect were analyzed using a backward stepwise analysis including the above-mentioned variables. The analysis showed that the extension of incubation time and reduction of NDF increased GP and CH4 values. Values of GP and CH4 also increased when rumen fluid was collected after feeding compared to before feeding (+26.4 and +9.0\\xa0mL/g DM, for GP and CH4), from bovine compared to sheep (+32.8 and +5.2\\xa0mL/g DM, for GP and CH4), and when the buffer solution did not contain N (+24.7 and +6.7\\xa0mL/g DM for GP and CH4). The increase of BRF/FS ratio enhanced GP and CH4 production (+7.7 and +3.3\\xa0mL/g DM per each class of increase, respectively). In vitro techniques for measuring GP and CH4 production are mostly used as screening methods, thus a full standardization of such techniques is not feasible. However, a greater harmonization of analytical procedures (i.e., a reduction in the number of available protocols) would be useful to facilitate comparison between results of different experiments.',\n",
       " 'Dietary lipid supplementation benefits the prolific and high-producing modern lactating sow. A comprehensive review of recent studies showed that lipid supplementation increases average daily energy intake, which is partitioned for lactation as indicated by greater milk fat output and improved litter growth rate. Recent compelling findings showed that addition of particular lipids during lactation improved the subsequent reproductive outcome of sows. Such benefits were related to the level of dietary essential fatty acids (EFA, linoleic acid, C18:2n-6; and α-linolenic acid, C18:3n-3) during lactation. Lactation diets without supplemental EFA resulted in a pronounced negative balance (intake minus milk output) of linoleic (−25.49\\xa0g/d) and α-linolenic acid (−2.75\\xa0g/d); which compromised sow fertility (farrowing rate\\u2009<\\u200975\\xa0% and culling rates\\u2009>\\u200925\\xa0% of weaned sows). This phenomenon seems to be increasingly important with advancing sow age because of a progressive reduction of body EFA pool over successive lactations. The net effect of supplemental EFA during lactation was to create a positive EFA balance, which improved the subsequent reproduction of sows. Adequate linoleic acid intake improved the proportion of sows that farrowed in the subsequent cycle (Farrowing rate (%)\\u2009=\\u2009[(−1.5\\u2009×\\u200910−3\\u2009×\\u2009linoleic acid intake (g/d)2)\\u2009+\\u2009(0.53\\u2009×\\u2009linoleic acid intake (g/d))\\u2009+\\u2009(45.2)]; quadratic P\\u2009=\\u20090.002, R2\\u2009=\\u20090.997, RMSE\\u2009=\\u20090.031). In addition, increasing linoleic acid intake increased the number of pigs born in the subsequent cycle (total pigs born (n)\\u2009=\\u2009[(9.4\\u2009×\\u200910−5\\u2009×\\u2009linoleic acid intake (g/d)2)\\u2009+\\u2009(0.04\\u2009×\\u2009linoleic acid intake (g/d))\\u2009+\\u2009(10.94)]; quadratic P\\u2009=\\u20090.002, R2\\u2009=\\u20090.997, RMSE\\u2009=\\u20090.031).

       " 'BackgroundResveratrol, an important phyto-antioxidant commonly found in grapes, mulberry, and other plants, has a variety of functions including anti-aging, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities. In the current study, we investigated the beneficial effects of resveratrol on in vitro porcine oocyte maturation under heat stress (HS). The effect of resveratrol, melatonin and their combination on alleviating HS was compared according to the maturation rate of oocytes and the development competence of embryos after parthenogenetic activation (PA).ResultsSupplementation with resveratrol (2.0\\xa0μmol/L) not only improved the nuclear maturation but also raised the blastocyst rate of porcine embryos’ PA from oocytes that underwent HS by increasing their glutathione (GSH) level, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and up-regulating the expression of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). It was also found that melatonin (10−7 mol/L) and the combination of resveratrol (2.0\\xa0μmol/L) plus melatonin (10−7 mol/L) exhibited more potent effects than resveratrol alone regarding their protective activities on oocyte maturation under HS.ConclusionsThis study compared the efficiencies of resveratrol, melatonin and their combination for protecting porcine oocytes from heat stress. The mechanisms are attributed to the fact that each treatment may have different ability to regulate the synthesis of steroid hormones and the expression of mature related genes.',\n",

Finally, benzoic acid supplementation increased the mRNA expression and concentration of glucagon-like peptide 2 and the activities of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the jejunal mucosa of young pigs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsIn conclusion, supplementation with 5000\\xa0mg/kg benzoic acid improved the performance of young pigs through promoting nutrient digestion, improving jejunal antioxidant capacity, and maintaining the jejunal morphology in young pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundEmbryonic mortality during the period of implantation strongly affects litter size in pigs. Progesterone receptor (PGR) paracrine signaling has been recognized to play a significant role in embryonic implantation. IHH, NR2F2, BMP2, FKBP4 and HAND2 were proved to involve in PGR paracrine signaling. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of IHH, NR2F2, BMP2, FKBP4 and HAND2 in endometrium of pregnant sows and to further investigate these genes’ effect on litter size in pigs. Real-time PCR, western blot and immunostaining were used to study target genes/proteins expression in endometrium in pigs. RFLP-PCR was used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of target genes.ResultsThe results showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of IHH, NR2F2 and BMP2 were up-regulated during implantation period (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05 or P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). All target proteins were mainly observed in luminal epithelium and glandular epithelium. Interestingly, the staining of NR2F2 and HAND2 was also strong in stroma. SNPs detection revealed that there was a -204C\\u2009>\\u2009A mutation in promoter region of NR2F2 gene. Three genotypes were found in Large White, Landrace and Duroc sows. A total of 1847 litter records from 625 sows genotyped at NR2F2 gene were used to analyze the total number born (TNB) and number born alive (NBA). The study of the effect on litter size suggested that sows with genotype CC tend to have higher litter size.ConclusionsThese results showed the expression patterns of genes/proteins involved in PGR paracrine signaling over implantation time. And the candidate gene for litter size was identified from genes involved in this signaling. This study could be a resource for further studies to identify the roles of these genes for embryonic implantation in pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundDensity gradient centrifugation was reported as a technique of semen preparation in assisted reproductive techniques in humans and animals. This technique was found to be efficient in improving semen quality after harmful techniques such as cryopreservation. Recently a modified technique, single layer centrifugation, was proposed as a technique providing a large amount of high quality spermatozoa, and this treatment was performed before conservation. Single layer centrifugation has been studied prevalently in stallions and in boars, but limited data were available for bulls. Occasionally bulls are known to experience a transient reduction in semen quality, thus techniques that allow improvement in semen quality could be applied in this context. The aim of this study was the evaluation of single layer and double layer centrifugation by the use of iodixanol, compared with conventional centrifugation and non-centrifuged semen, on the sperm characteristics during the cryopreservation process in bulls with normal and poor semen quality.ResultsSingle layer centrifugation and double layer centrifugation both significantly increased the percentage of normal spermatozoa and decreased the percentage of non-sperm cells in poor quality samples, while both were ineffective in those of normal quality. Sperm characteristics in poor quality samples increased after single layer centrifugation and double layer centrifugation, reaching values similar to those recorded in normal samples, and this trend is maintained after equilibration and after cryopreservation. On the other hand, SLC and DLC resulted in a consistent reduction in the spermatozoa recovered, and this resulted in a reduction of the absolute amount of spermatozoa cryopreserved in the normal samples, without a clear improvement in sperm characteristics in this type of sample.ConclusionsThese data suggested that both SLC and DLC could be performed in practice, but their application should be limited to the cases in which the quality of the spermatozoa recovered is more important than the total amount of spermatozoa.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundRecent technological advances in genomics have allowed the genotyping of cattle through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels. High-density SNP panels possess greater genome coverage and are useful for the identification of conserved regions of the genome due to selection, known as selection signatures (SS). The SS are detectable by different methods, such as the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH); and the integrated haplotype score (iHS), which is derived from the EHH. The aim of this study was to identify SS regions in Canchim cattle (composite breed), genotyped with high-density SNP panel.ResultsA total of 687,655 SNP markers and 396 samples remained for SS analysis after the genotype quality control. The iHS statistic for each marker was transformed into piHS for better interpretation of the results. Chromosomes BTA5 and BTA14 showed piHS\\u2009>\\u20095, with 39 and nine statistically significant SNPs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.00001), respectively. For the candidate selection regions, iHS values were computed across the genome and averaged within non-overlapping windows of 500 Kb. We have identified genes that play an important role in metabolism, melanin biosynthesis (pigmentation), and embryonic and bone development.ConclusionsThe observation of SS indicates that the selection processes performed in Canchim, as well as in the founder breeds (i.e. Charolais), are maintaining specific genomic regions, particularly on BTA5 and BTA14. These selection signatures regions could be associated with Canchim characterization.',\n",

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prolonged effect of GLP-2 on the growth performance of weaned piglets. Forty piglets weaned at the age of 28 d with an average BW of 6.8\\u2009±\\u20090.4\\xa0kg were assigned to four treatments: (i) non-challenged control; (ii) LPS-challenged control; (iii) LPS\\u2009+\\u2009low GLP-2; and (iv) LPS\\u2009+\\u2009high GLP-2. Piglets in groups (i), (ii), and (iv) were s.c. injected with PBS supplemented with human [Gly2]GLP-21-34 at doses of 0, 2 and 10\\xa0nmol/kg BW per day for seven consecutive days. BW, gain:feed ratio (G:F), and plasma GLP-2 levels were determined on d 0, 7, and 14 after weaning. Piglets were challenged with i.p. administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a dose of 100\\xa0μg/kg on d 14 to induce intestinal damage. Twenty-four hours later, intestinal tract samples were collected to assess intestinal morphology and quantify enzyme activity.ResultsPlasma GLP-2 levels decreased after weaning, but in the high GLP-2 group, plasma GLP-2 was maintained on d 7 and even increased to a level higher than the preweaning level on d 14 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). High GLP-2 treatment significantly increased the duodenal, jejunal and ileal weight, as well as the gross weight of the small intestine (SI), and the SI weight index (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). LPS caused villous atrophy and disrupted intestinal morphology in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. GLP-2 also significantly increased the villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio (VCR) of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Histological examination revealed that in GLP-2-treated groups, the integrity of the villus was maintained, and the villus was protected against LPS-induced damage. GLP-2 significantly increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP), γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (γ-GT), and pancreatic lipase in the duodenum and jejunum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). GLP-2 treatment also significantly increased the average daily gain (ADG) and G:F of piglets at 0 to 7, 7 to 14, as well as 0 to14 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), resulting in a significant increase of final BW in high GLP-2 pigs (P\\u2009=\\u20090.016).ConclusionsExogenous GLP-2 improved the growth of weaned piglets and protected them against LPS-induced intestinal damage. These effects may be due to the ability of GLP-2 to promote the secretion of endogenous GLP-2 to stimulate the small intestinal development.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundRumen microbiome has a great influence on ruminant health and productivity. Different plant extracts have been tested for their ability to modulate the rumen microbiome to improve feed digestion and fermentation. Among the evaluated plant extracts, essential oils, tannins, and saponins appeared to have positive effects on rumen protein metabolism, volatile fatty acids production, and methane and ammonia production.MethodsThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) leaves and essential oils on rumen microbial populations. Four ruminally cannulated sheep were used in a 4×4 Latin square design fed (21 d/period): 1) a control diet composed of alfalfa hay and concentrate pellet (CTR), 2) CTR supplemented with 7\\xa0g/d/sheep of rosemary essential oil adsorbed on an inert support (EO), 3) CTR with 10\\xa0g/d/sheep of dried and ground rosemary leaves (RL), and 4) CTR with 10\\xa0g/d of dried and ground rosemary leaves pelleted into concentrate (RL pellet). Abundance of total bacteria, archaea, protozoa, and some select bacterial species or groups was quantified using qPCR, while the community of bacteria and archaea was profiled using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.ResultsNo difference in abundance was noted for total bacteria, protozoa, or Ruminococcus flavefaciens between the control and the treatments, but the rosemary leaves, either in loose form or in pellet, decreased the abundance of archaea and the genus Prevotella (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The rosemary leaves in loose form also decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) the abundance of Ruminococcus albus and Clostridium aminophilum, while the EO increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) the abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes. The community of bacteria and archaea was not affected by any of the supplements.ConclusionsBeing able to affect the abundance of several groups of rumen microbes that are known to be involved in degradation of protein and fiber and production of methane and ammonia, rosemary leaves may be used to modulate rumen microbiome and its function.',\n",

The objective of this investigation was to evaluate whether there are alterations in several selected serum variables related to innate immunity and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that precede occurrence of RP in transition Holstein dairy cows.MethodsOne hundred multiparous Holstein dairy cows were involved in the study. Blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein during the −8 to +4 wks around parturition, once per week before the morning feeding. Six healthy control cows (CON) and 6 cows with RP were selected and serum samples at −8, −4, time of diagnosis of disease, and +4 wks relative to parturition were used for analyses. All samples were analyzed for lactate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), haptoglobin (Hp), and serum amyloid A (SAA).ResultsCows with RP had greater concentrations of serum lactate, IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and SAA in comparison with CON cows. Intriguingly, elevated concentrations of all five variables were observed at −8 and −4 wks before the occurrence of RP compared to healthy cows. Cows with RP also had lower DMI and milk production vs CON animals; however milk composition was not affected by RP.ConclusionsCows with RP showed an activated innate immunity 8 wks prior to diagnosis of disease. Overall results suggest that serum IL-1, IL- 6, and TNF, and lactate can be used as screening biomarkers to indicate cows that might have health issues during the transition period.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPorcine adipose tissue expresses orosomucoid (ORM1) mRNA, a protein with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Previous research has demonstrated that porcine ORM1 can reduce insulin stimulated glucose metabolism in porcine adipose tissue in vitro. The present study was designed to examine the preweaning ontogeny of ORM1 mRNA abundance in porcine subcutaneous adipose and to determine if ORM1 can regulate mRNA abundance of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to insulin resistance in primary cultures derived from neonatal porcine subcutaneous adipose tissue. Cultures were differentiated in vitro and subsequently the adipocyte containing cultures were incubated for 24\\xa0h with 0–5000\\xa0ng porcine ORM1/mL medium. Cultures were then harvested, total RNA extracted for use in reverse transcription and the mRNA abundance of cytokine mRNA quantified by real-time PCR.ResultsORM1 mRNA abundance within neonatal adipose tissue does not change from d\\xa01 to d\\xa021 of age and is a very small fraction relative to liver mRNA abundance. The ORM1 mRNA level in porcine adipocytes and stromal-vascular cells are similar (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Treatment with ORM1 did not affect TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α) mRNA level (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05), while interleukin 6 (IL6) mRNA abundance was reduced 32\\xa0% at 1,000\\xa0ng ORM1/mL (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). However, TNFα protein content in the cell culture media was reduced by ORM1 treatment (5,000\\xa0ng/mL, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), whereas ORM1 had no detectable effect on the media content of IL6 (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). The reduction of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) mRNA abundance by ORM1 was dose dependent (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) mRNA level was reduced 27\\xa0% by 1,000\\xa0ng ORM1/mL (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe data suggest that ORM1 has limited effects TNFα, IL6, MIF or MCP expression at the concentrations tested. Secondly, these cytokines do not appear to contribute to the reported insulin resistance induced by ORM1 in porcine adipose tissue in vitro as an increase in the abundance of these inflammatory cytokines would be predicted during an insulin resistant state.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundGlucocorticoids (GCs) are involved in the control of appetite in birds and mammals. The effect of GCs on feed intake in birds depends on their dietary energy level. But the regulation mechanism of GCs on appetite is still unclear in chickens facing to different energy level. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on hypothalamic expression of appetite-related peptides in chickens fed high/low fat diet and under fasting/feeding condition.ResultsAn interaction between DEX injection and dietary energy level was found on hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene expression in fasted chickens (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The chickens, given a DEX injection and a low fat diet treatment, had the highest CRH mRNA levels than any of the fasted chickens given treatments (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Under fasting conditions, the DEX treatment significantly increased hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and GC receptors mRNA levels (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Under re-feeding conditions, DEX treatment significantly decreased hypothalamic expression levels of NPY and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) but significantly increased the level of hypothalamic CRH expression (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionA regulatory network formed by NPY, AgRP and CRH is associated with the appetite-control by GCs. The result suggests that the regulation of GCs on orexigenic neuropeptides expression is dependent at least partially on dietary energy level and feeding state.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundFat is the primary source of the volatiles that determine the characteristic flavors of animal products. Because unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) contribute to changes in flavor as a result of the oxidation process, a feeding trial was performed to investigate the effects of dietary soybean oil or antioxidants on the fatty acid and volatile profiles of the tail subcutaneous (SF) and perirenal fat tissues (PF) of fattening lambs. Thirty-six Huzhou lambs were assigned to four dietary treatments in a randomized block design. The lambs’ diets were supplemented with soybean oil (0 or 3\\xa0% of DM) or antioxidants (0 or 0.025\\xa0% of DM).ResultsNeither soybean oil nor antioxidant supplementation had an effect on lamb growth (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). In regard to tail SF, soybean oil supplementation increased the 18:2n6t (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and the total amount of volatile acids, whereas antioxidant supplementation increased the content of C18:2n6c and C18:3n3 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) but had no effect on the volatiles profile. In regard to PF, dietary soybean oil supplementation increased the C18:0 content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01); decreased the C18:1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.01), C22:1 n9 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and total UFA (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) contents; and tended to decrease the E-2-octenal (P\\u2009=\\u20090.08), E, E-2, 4-decadienal (P\\u2009=\\u20090.10), 2-undecenal (P\\u2009=\\u20090.14) and ethyl 9-decenoate (P\\u2009=\\u20090.10) contents. Antioxidant supplementation did not affect either the fatty acid content or the volatiles profile in the PF.ConclusionsTail SF and PF responded to dietary soybean oil and antioxidant supplementation in different ways. For SF, both soybean oil and antioxidant supplementation increased the levels of unsaturated fatty acids but triggered only a slight change in volatiles. For PF, soybean oil supplementation decreased the levels of unsaturated fatty acids and oxidative volatiles, but supplementation with antioxidants had little effect on PF fatty acids and the volatiles profile.',\n",

This study aimed to examine dose and time responses of algae supplementation on rumen fermentation, biohydrogenation and Butyrivibrio group bacteria in goats.MethodsSix goats were used in a repeated 3\\u2009×\\u20093 Latin square design, and offered a fixed diet. Algae were infused through rumen cannule with 0 (Control), 6.1 (L-Alg), or 18.3\\xa0g (H-Alg) per day. Rumen contents were sampled on d 0, 3, 7, 14 and 20.ResultsH-Alg reduced total volatile fatty acid concentration and acetate molar proportion (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and increased propionate molar proportion (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), whereas L-Alg had no effect on rumen fermentation. Changes in proportions of acetate and propionate in H-Alg were obvious from d 7 onwards and reached the largest differences with the control on d 14. Algae induced a dose-dependent decrease in 18:0 and increased trans-18:1 in the ruminal content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). H-Alg increased the concentrations of t9, t11-18:2 and t11, c15-18:2 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). L-Alg only seemed to induce a transient change in 18-carbon isomers, while H-Alg induced a rapid elevation, already obvious on d 3, concentrations of these fatty acid rose in some cases again on d 20. Algae had no effect on the abundances of Butyrivibrio spp. and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10), while H-Alg reduced the total bacteria abundance (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). However, this was induced by a significant difference between control and H-Alg on d 14 (-4.43\\xa0%). Afterwards, both treatments did not differ as increased variation in the H-Alg repetitions, with in some cases a return of the bacterial abundance to the basal level (d 0).ConclusionsChanges in rumen fermentation and 18-carbon UFAs metabolism in response to algae were related to the supplementation level, but there was no evidence of shift in ruminal biohydrogenation pathways towards t10-18:1. L-Alg mainly induced a transient effect on rumen biohydrogenation of 18-carbon UFAs, while H-Alg showed an acute inhibition and these effects were not associated with the known hydrogenating bacteria.',\n",
       " 'Milk is synthesized by mammary epithelial cells of lactating mammals. The synthetic capacity of the mammary gland depends largely on the number and efficiency of functional mammary epithelial cells. Structural development of the mammary gland occurs during fetal growth, prepubertal and post-pubertal periods, pregnancy, and lactation under the control of various hormones (particularly estrogen, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I, progesterone, placental lactogen, and prolactin) in a species- and stage-dependent manner. Milk is essential for the growth, development, and health of neonates. Amino acids (AA), present in both free and peptide-bound forms, are the most abundant organic nutrients in the milk of farm animals. Uptake of AA from the arterial blood of the lactating dam is the ultimate source of proteins (primarily β-casein and α-lactalbumin) and bioactive nitrogenous metabolites in milk. Results of recent studies indicate extensive catabolism of branched-chain AA (leucine, isoleucine and valine) and arginine to synthesize glutamate, glutamine, alanine, aspartate, asparagine, proline, and polyamines. The formation of polypeptides from AA is regulated not only by hormones (e.g., prolactin, insulin and glucocorticoids) and the rate of blood flow across the lactating mammary gland, but also by concentrations of AA, lipids, glucose, vitamins and minerals in the maternal plasma, as well as the activation of the mechanistic (mammalian) target rapamycin signaling by certain AA (e.g., arginine, branched-chain AA, and glutamine). Knowledge of AA utilization (including metabolism) by mammary epithelial cells will enhance our fundamental understanding of lactation biology and has important implications for improving the efficiency of livestock production worldwide.',\n",

We used PCR and Sanger sequencing to screen for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5ʹ-flanking DNA and exons of the VEGFA gene. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blots were used to measure expression levels and PCR products were sequenced.ResultsResults showed that the VEGFA mRNA and protein expression in heart, liver and kidney of TP was higher than that in YH and YL. In addition, the mRNA sequence of the pig VEGFA gene was conserved among pig breeds, and only five SNPs were found in the 5ʹ-flanking region of the VEGFA gene, the allele frequency distributions of the 5 SNPs were not significantly different between the TP, Yorkshire (YL), and Diannan small-ear (DN) pig populations.ConclusionIn conclusion, the Tibetan pig showed high levels of VEGFA gene expression in several hypoxic tissues, which suggests that the VEGFA gene may play a major functional role in hypoxic adaptation.',\n",

A total of 448 1-day-old male broiler chicks were allocated into eight treatment groups following a 4\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement with four dietary EO dosages (0, 60, 120, or 240\\xa0mg/kg) and two infection status (with or without C. perfringens challenge from d 14 to 20).ResultsThe challenge did not impair the growth performance of birds, but induced gut lesions and increased crypt depth in the ileum (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05). It also down-regulated the claudin-1 and occludin mRNA expression (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05), up-regulated the mRNA expression of interleukin-1β (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05), tended to increase the toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 mRNA expression (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) in the ileum, and enhanced the mucosal secretory IgA production (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05).

From d −21 to calving, cows were randomly assigned to a higher-energy diet (OVE, n\\u2009=\\u20099; NEL\\u2009=\\u20091.54 Mcal/kg DM), OVE plus SM (OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM, n\\u2009=\\u200910; SM\\u2009=\\u20090.07\\xa0% of DM) or remained on CON (n\\u2009=\\u20099). All cows received the same basal lactation diet (NEL\\u2009=\\u20091.75 Mcal/kg DM). Supplementation of SM (OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM) continued until 30 d postpartum. Liver biopsies were harvested at d −10, 7, and 21 relative to parturition. Blood PMN isolated at −10, 3, and 21 d relative to calving was used to evaluate gene expression. As expected, OVE increased liver lipid content postpartum; however, cows fed OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM or CON had lower concentrations than OVE. Compared with OVE, cows in CON and OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM had greater DMI postpartum and milk production. Furthermore, cows fed OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM had the greatest milk protein and fat percentage and lowest milk SCC despite having intermediate PMN phagocytic capacity. Adaptations in PMN gene expression in OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM cows associated with the lower SCC were gradual increases from −10 to 21 d in genes that facilitate migration into inflammatory sites (SELL, ITGAM), enzymes essential for reducing reactive oxygen metabolites (SOD1, SOD2), and a transcription factor(s) required for controlling PMN development (RXRA). The greater expression of TLR4 on d 3, key for activation of innate immunity due to inflammation, in OVE compared with CON cows suggests a more pronounced inflammatory state. Feeding OVE\\u2009+\\u2009SM dampened the upregulation of TLR4, despite the fact that these cows had similar expression of the pro-inflammatory genes NFKB1 and TNF as OVE. Cows in CON had lower overall expression of these inflammation-related genes and GSR, which generates reduced glutathione, an important cellular antioxidant.ConclusionsAlthough CON cows appeared to have a less stressful transition into lactation, SM supplementation was effective in alleviating negative effects of energy-overfeeding. As such, SM was beneficial in terms of production and appeared to boost the response of PMN in a way that improved overall cow health.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAdult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be conveniently sampled from bone marrow, peripheral blood, muscle, adipose and connective tissue, harvested from various species, including, rodents, dogs, cats, horses, sheep, goats and human beings. The MSCs isolated from adult tissues vary in their morphological and functional properties. These variations are further complicated when cells are expanded by passaging in culture. These differences and changes in MSCs must be considered prior to their application in the clinic or in a basic research study. Goats are commonly used as animal models for bone tissue engineering to test the potential of stem cells for bone regeneration. As a result, goat MSCs isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue should be evaluated using in vitro assays, prior to their application in a tissue engineering project.ResultsIn this study, we compared the stem cell properties of MSCs isolated from goat bone marrow and adipose tissue. We used quantitative and qualitative assays with a focus on osteogenesis, including, colony forming unit, rate of cell proliferation, tri-lineage differentiation and expression profiling of key signal transduction proteins to compare MSCs from low and high passages. Primary cultures generated from each source displayed the stem cell characteristics, with variations in their osteogenic potentials. Most importantly, low passaged bone marrow MSCs displayed a significantly higher and superior osteogenic potential, and hence, will be the preferred choice for bone tissue engineering in future in vivo experiments. In the bone marrow MSCs, this process is potentially mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. On the other hand, osteogenic differentiation in the adipose tissue MSCs may involve the p44/42 MAPK pathway.ConclusionsBased on these data, we can conclude that bone marrow and fat-derived MSCs undergo osteogenesis via two distinct signaling pathways. Even though the bone marrow MSCs are the preferred source for bone tissue engineering, the adipose tissue MSCs are an attractive alternative source and undergo osteo-differentiation differently from the bone marrow MSCs and hence, might require a cell-based enhancer/inducer to improve their osteogenic regenerative capacity.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn order to improve the efficiency of bovine sperm cryopreservation process, it is important to understand how spermatozoa respond to differences in temperature as well as the ability to recover its own metabolism. The combination between flow cytometry approach and antioxidant enzymes activity allows a more sensible evaluation of sperm cell during cryopreservation. The aim of this study was to evaluate sperm attributes and antioxidant enzymes activity during different stages of cryopreservation process. Semen samples from Holstein bulls (n\\u2009=\\u20094) were separated in 3 treatments: fresh (37\\xa0°C); cooled (5\\xa0°C); and thawed. Evaluation occurred at 0\\xa0h and 2\\xa0h after incubation. Membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and DNA damages were evaluated by flow cytometry; activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and gluthatione peroxidase were measured by spectrofotometry.ResultsThere was an increase in the percentage of sperm with DNA damage in the thawed group, compared to fresh and cooled, and for 2 hs of incubation when compared to 0\\xa0h. Considering MMP, there was an increase in the percentage of cells with medium potential in thawed group when compared to fresh and cooled groups. Opposingly, a decrease was observed in the thawed group considering high mitochondrial potential. Also in the thawed group, there was an increase on cells with damaged acrosome and membrane when compared to fresh and cooled groups. Significant correlations were found between antioxidant enzymes activity and membrane or mitochondrial parameters.ConclusionBased on our results, we conclude that cryopreservation affects cellular and DNA integrity and that the critical moment is when sperm cells are exposed to freezing temperature. Also, our study indicates that intracellular antioxidant machinery (SOD and GPX enzymes) is not enough to control cryodamage.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe current study was conducted to evaluate egg quality and egg yolk fatty acids and immunoglobulin (IgY) content from laying hens fed full fat camelina or flax seed.MethodsA total of 75, 48-week-old Lohman brown hens were randomly allocated to 3 treatments, with 5 replicates containing 5 laying hens each replicate. The hens were fed corn-soybean basal diet (Control), or Control diet with 10\\xa0% of full fat camelina (Camelina) or flax seed (Flax) for a period of 16\\xa0wk. Hen production performance egg quality, egg yolk lipids, fatty acids and IgY were determined every 28\\xa0d during the experimental period.ResultsEgg production was higher in hens fed Camelina and Flax than in Control hens (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Egg weight and albumen weight was lowest in eggs from hens fed Camelina (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Shell weight relative to egg weight (shell weight %), and shell thickness was lowest in eggs from hens fed Flax (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). No difference was noted in Haugh unit, yolk:albumen ratio, and yolk weight. Significant increase in α-linolenic (18:3 n-3), docosapentaenoic (22:5 n-3) and docoshexaenoic (22:6 n-3) acids were observed in egg yolk from hens fed Camelina and Flax. Total n-3 fatty acids constituted 1.19\\xa0% in Control eggs compared to 3.12 and 3.09\\xa0% in Camelina and Flax eggs, respectively (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Eggs from hens fed Camelina and Flax had the higher IgY concentration than those hens fed Control diet when expressed on a mg/g of yolk basis (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Although the egg weight was significantly lower in Camelina-fed hens, the total egg content of IgY was highest in eggs from hens fed Camelina (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe egg n-3 fatty acid and IgY enhancing effect of dietary camelina seed warrants further attention into the potential of using camelina as a functional feed ingredient in poultry feeding.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundZearalenone (ZEN) is an estrogenic mycotoxin that is primarily produced by Fusarium fungi and has been proven to affect the reproductive capacity of many species to varying degrees. The present experiment was designed to study the maternal persistent effects of zearalenone toxicity in gestating sows on growth and muscle development of their offsprings, and the alleviation of zearalenone toxicity by modified halloysite nanotubes (MHNTs).MethodsEighteen sows were fed with one of three dietary treatments that included the following: (1) a control diet, (2) a contaminated grain diet (with 50\\xa0% moldy corn, 2.77\\xa0mg/kg ZEN), and (3) a contaminated grain diet (with 50\\xa0% moldy corn, 2.76\\xa0mg/kg ZEN)\\u2009+\\u20091\\xa0% MHNTs. Each sow was exclusively fed its experimental diets from 35 to 70 d of gestation at a total of 2\\xa0kg daily. Muscle samples were collected from six piglets per treatment at birth, weaning and finishing.ResultsThe results showed that feeding the sows with the ZEN-contaminated diets from 35 to 70 d of gestation decreased the ADG, ADFI and G:F of their offsprings (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The muscle fiber numbers in the newborn, weaning and growing-finishing pigs and the muscle fiber diameters at birth and weaning were also decreased by maternal ZEN exposure (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The expressions of IGF-I, IGF-II, Myf-5 and Mstn at birth and IGF-II, Pax7, Myf-5 and MyoD1 at weaning were altered by feeding gestating sows with ZEN-contaminated diets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The MHNTs reduced most of the ZEN-induced toxic effects: the ADG and ADFI on growth performance, the muscle fiber numbers at weaning and finishing and the muscle fiber diameters at weaning (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The expression levels of IGF-II and Mstn in newborn piglets and IGF-II and Myf-5 in weaning piglets were also prevented by adding 1\\xa0% MHNTs (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsThe present study demonstrated that the offsprings of sows fed with ZEN-contaminated diets from 35 to 70 day of gestation exhibited weakening on growth performance, physiological changes in their muscle fibers and alterations of mRNA expression in their muscle tissues, and also indicated that MHNTs prevented most of the ZEN-induced weakening in the muscle tissues.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe goal of this study was to compare the antagonism of elevated dietary Cu (250\\xa0mg/kg) from CuSO4 on three different Zn sources (ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O; [Zn bis(−2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid)], Zn(HMTBa)2, a chelated Zn methionine hydroxy analogue; and Zn-Methionine), as measured using multiple indices of animal performance in ROSS 308 broilers.MethodsThree experiments were conducted in broiler chicks fed a semi-purified diet. All birds were fed a Zn-deficient diet (8.5\\xa0mg/kg diet) for 1\\xa0wk, and then provided with the experimental diets for 2\\xa0wks.ResultsExperiment 1 was a 2 × 2 factorial design with two levels of Cu (8 vs. 250\\xa0mg/kg diet from CuSO4) and two Zn sources at 30\\xa0mg/kg [ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O vs. Zn(HMTBa)2]. Elevated Cu impaired growth performance only in birds fed ZnSO4. Compared to ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O, Zn(HMTBa)2 improved feed intake (12\\xa0%; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and weight gain (12\\xa0%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and the benefits were more pronounced in the presence of 250\\xa0mg/kg diet Cu. Experiment 2 was a dose titration of ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O and Zn(HMTBa)2 at 30, 45, 60, and 75\\xa0mg/kg diet in the presence of 250\\xa0mg/kg CuSO4. Feed:gain was decreased and tibia Zn was increased with increasing Zn levels from 30 to 75\\xa0mg/kg. Birds fed Zn(HMTBa)2 consumed more food and gained more weight compared to birds fed ZnSO4, especially at lower supplementation levels (30 and 45\\xa0mg/kg; interaction P\\u2009<\\u20090,05). Experiment 3 compared two organic Zn sources (Zn(HMTBa)2 vs. Zn-Methionine) at 30\\xa0mg/kg with or without 250\\xa0mg/kg CuSO4. No interactions were observed between Zn sources and Cu levels on performance or tissue mineral concentrations. High dietary Cu decreased weight gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Tibia Cu and liver Cu were significantly increased with 250\\xa0mg/kg dietary Cu supplementation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). No difference was observed between the two Zn sources.ConclusionsDietary 250\\xa0mg/kg Cu significantly impaired feed intake and weight gain in birds fed ZnSO4\\u2009·\\u2009H2O, but had less impact in birds fed Zn(HMTBa)2. No difference was observed between the two organic zinc sources. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that chelated organic Zn is better utilized than inorganic zinc in the presence of elevated Cu.',\n",

       " 'Establishment of embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines has been successful in mouse and human, but not in farm animals. Development of direct reprogramming technology offers an alternative approach for generation of pluripotent stem cells, applicable also in farm animals. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent practically limitless, ethically acceptable, individuum-specific source of pluripotent cells that can be generated from different types of somatic cells. iPSCs can differentiate to all cell types of an organism’s body and have a tremendous potential for numerous applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. However, molecular mechanisms behind the reprogramming process remain largely unknown and hamper generation of bona fide iPSCs and their use in human clinical practice. Large animal models are essential to expand the knowledge obtained on rodents and facilitate development and validation of transplantation therapies in preclinical studies. Additionally, transgenic animals with special traits could be generated from genetically modified pluripotent cells, using advanced reproduction techniques. Despite their applicative potential, it seems that iPSCs in farm animals haven’t received the deserved attention. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic overview on iPSC generation in the most important mammalian farm animal species (cattle, pig, horse, sheep, goat, and rabbit), compare protein sequence similarity of pluripotency-related transcription factors in different species, and discuss potential uses of farm animal iPSCs. Literature mining revealed 32 studies, describing iPSC generation in pig (13 studies), cattle (5), horse (5), sheep (4), goat (3), and rabbit (2) that are summarized in a concise, tabular format.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThere is little information in the tropics with regard the comparative understanding of how an increased nitrogen supply in the rumen or in the intestines affects efficiency of nitrogen utilization in cattle. This study evaluated the effects of supplementation with nitrogenous compounds in the rumen, abomasum, or both on intake, digestibility and the characteristics of nitrogen utilization in cattle fed tropical forage. Four rumen- and abomasum-fistulated Nellore bulls (227\\u2009±\\u200911\\xa0kg) were used. Four treatments were evaluated: control, ruminal supplementation (230\\xa0g/d of supplemental protein in the rumen), abomasal supplementation (230\\xa0g/d of supplemental protein in the abomasum), and ruminal and abomasal supplementation (115\\xa0g/d protein in both the rumen and the abomasum). The basal forage diet consisted of Tifton 85 hay with a crude protein (CP) level of 78.4\\xa0g/kg dry matter. Casein was used as a supplement. The experiment was conducted using a 4\\u2009×\\u20094 Latin square.ResultsThere were no differences between the treatments (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) with regard to forage intake. The intake and total digestibility of CP increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) with supplementation. The nitrogen balance in the body increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and muscle protein mobilization decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) with supplementation, regardless of the supplementation site. The efficiency of nitrogen utilization did not differ among the treatments (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10).ConclusionsThe supplementation of cattle fed tropical forage with protein in the rumen, abomasum, or both similarly increased the nitrogen accretion in animal, which reflects improvements on nitrogen status in animal body.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundTo explore the relationship between the heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) gene and intramuscular fat (IMF), a polymorphism of the second exon of the H-FABP gene was investigated in 60 Three-yellow chickens (TYCs) and 60 Hetian-black chickens (HTBCs).ResultsThe IMF contents of the cardiac, chest and leg muscles in HTBC were increased compared with TYC. Both TYC and HTBC populations exhibited Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) according to the χ2 test. Three variations of the two birds were detected, namely, G939A, G982A and C1014T. HTBCs with the TT genotypes exhibit increased IMF content in the chest muscles compared with the TC genotype. Thus, the G982A site could be considered a genetic marker for selecting increased IMF content in the chest muscles of HTBC. The correlation coefficients revealed that H-FABP mRNA expression was negatively correlated with the IMF content in the cardiac, chest and leg muscles of HTBC and in the cardiac and chest muscles of TYC. The relative mRNA expression of H-FABP was reduced in the cardiac and leg muscles of HTBC compared with TYC, but this difference was not observed at the protein level, as assessed by Western blot analysis.ConclusionsThese findings offer essential data that can be useful in the breeding program of HTBC and future research exploring the role of H-FABP in IMF deposition and regulation in chickens.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundBovine milk contains not only a variety of nutritional ingredients but also microRNAs (miRNAs) that are thought to be secreted by the bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). The objective of this study was to elucidate the production of milk-related miRNAs in BMECs under the influence of lactogenic hormones.ResultsAccording to a microarray result of milk exosomal miRNAs prior to cellular analyses, a total of 257 miRNAs were detected in a Holstein cow milk. Of these, 18 major miRNAs of interest in the milk were selected for an expression analysis in BMEC culture that was treated with or without dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin (DIP) to induce a lactogenic differentiation. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results showed that the expressions of miR-21–5p (P\\u2009=\\u20090.005), miR-26a (P\\u2009=\\u20090.016), and miR-320a (P\\u2009=\\u20090.011) were lower in the DIP-treated cells than in the untreated cells. In contrast, the expression of miR-339a (P\\u2009=\\u20090.017) in the cell culture medium were lower in the DIP-treated culture than in the untreated culture. Intriguingly, the miR-148a expression in cell culture medium was elevated by DIP treatment of BMEC culture (P\\u2009=\\u20090.018). The medium-to-cell expression ratios of miR-103 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.025), miR-148a (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and miR-223 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.013) were elevated in the DIP-treated BMECs, suggesting that the lactogenic differentiation-induced secretion of these three miRNAs in BMECs. A bioinformatic analysis showed that the miRNAs down-regulated in the BMECs were associated with the suppression of genes related to transcriptional regulation, protein phosphorylation, and tube development.ConclusionThe results suggest that the miRNAs changed by lactogenic hormones are associated with milk protein synthesis, and mammary gland development and maturation. The elevated miR-148a level in DIP-treated BMECs may be associated with its increase in milk during the lactation period of cows.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAccurate evaluation of SNP effects is important for genome wide association studies and for genomic prediction. The genetic architecture of quantitative traits differs widely, with some traits exhibiting few if any quantitative trait loci (QTL) with large effects, while other traits have one or several easily detectable QTL with large effects.MethodsBody weight in broilers and egg weight in layers are two examples of traits that have QTL of large effect. A commonly used method for genome wide association studies is to fit a mixture model such as BayesB that assumes some known proportion of SNP effects are zero. In contrast, the most commonly used method for genomic prediction is known as GBLUP, which involves fitting an animal model to phenotypic data with the variance-covariance or genomic relationship matrix among the animals being determined by genome wide SNP genotypes. Genotypes at each SNP are typically weighted equally in determining the genomic relationship matrix for GBLUP. We used the equivalent marker effects model formulation of GBLUP for this study. We compare these two classes of models using egg weight data collected over 8 generations from 2,324 animals genotyped with a 42\\xa0K SNP panel.ResultsUsing data from the first 7 generations, both BayesB and GBLUP found the largest QTL in a similar well-recognized QTL region, but this QTL was estimated to account for 24\\xa0% of genetic variation with BayesB and less than 1\\xa0% with GBLUP. When predicting phenotypes in generation 8 BayesB accounted for 36\\xa0% of the phenotypic variation and GBLUP for 25\\xa0%. When using only data from any one generation, the same QTL was identified with BayesB in all but one generation but never with GBLUP. Predictions of phenotypes in generations 2 to 7 based on only 295 animals from generation 1 accounted for 10\\xa0% phenotypic variation with BayesB but only 6\\xa0% with GBLUP. Predicting phenotype using only the marker effects in the 1\\xa0Mb region that accounted for the largest effect on egg weight from generation 1 data alone accounted for almost 8\\xa0% variation using BayesB but had no predictive power with GBLUP.ConclusionsIn conclusion, In the presence of large effect QTL, BayesB did a better job of QTL detection and its genomic predictions were more accurate and persistent than those from GBLUP.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundTo investigate the effect of feeding a linseed-enriched diet to growing-finishing pigs on gene expression in skeletal muscle, pigs were fed with a linseed-enriched diet for 0, 30, 60 and 90 d. Transcriptional profiles of longissimus dorsi muscle were measured using Affymetrix Genechip.ResultsResults showed that 264 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The strongest transcriptional response was clearly observed at 30 d. DEGs were assigned to several main functional terms, including transcription, apoptosis, intracellular receptor-mediated signaling, muscle organ development, fatty acid metabolic process, cell motion, regulation of glucose metabolic process, spermatogenesis and regulation of myeloid cell differentiation. We also found that transcriptional changs of several transcription cofactors might contribute to n-3 PUFAs regulated gene expression. In addition, the increased expression of IGF-1, insulin signaling pathway and the metabolism of amino acids might involve in the muscle growth induced by feeding a linseed-enriched diet. The results also provide the new evidence that the expression changes of PTPN1, HK2 and PGC-1α might contribute to the regulation of insulin sensitivity by n-3 PUFAs.ConclusionsOur finding provided correlative evidence that feeding the linseed enriched diet affact expression of genes involved in insulin signaling pathway and the metabolism of amino acids.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundTo understand the impact of feeding a high-concentrate diet to mid-lactating goats for a long time on liver metabolism and inflammatory response, two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and real-time PCR method were employed to detect proteins differentially expressed in liver and their mRNAs expression in goats fed high concentrate diet (HC) or low concentrate diet (LC). Twelve lactating dairy goats were randomly assigned to either a HC diet group (65 % concentrate of dry matter; n = 6) or a LC diet group (35 % concentrate of dry matter; n = 6) for 10 wk.ResultsTwenty differentially expressed spots (≥2.0-fold changes) in the hepatic tissues were excised and successfully identified using MALDI TOF/TOF. Of these, 8 proteins were up-regulated, while the rest 12 proteins were down-regulated in HC goats compared to LC. Differential expressed proteins including alpha enolase 1 (ENO1), glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), glutathione S-transferase A1 (GSTA1), ATP synthase subunit 5β (ATP5β), superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (SOD1), cytochrom c oxidase subunit Via (COX6A1) and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) were further verified by real-time PCR and/or western blot at mRNA or protein expression level. Consistent with the 2-DE results, a significant decrease of β-actin protein expression and SOD enzyme activity was observed in liver of HC goats (P < 0.05), while ENO1 protein expression was significantly up-regulated in HC compared to LC goats (P < 0.05) . However, western blot analysis did not show a significant difference of hepatic HSP60 protein between HC and LC group, which did not match the decrease of HSP60 content detected by 2-DE analysis. Real-time PCR showed that glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) and SOD1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in liver of HC goats, while cytochrom c oxidase (COX3) and ATPase 8 (ATP8) mRNAs expression were markedly increased compared to LC (P < 0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that HC diet resulted in altered expression of proteins related to catalytic and mitochondrial metabolism in the liver, and may increase the stress response with up-regulating the expression of differentiation 14 (CD14) cluster and serum amyloid A (SAA) as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) in the liver.ConclusionsThese results suggest that feeding high concentrate diet to lactating goats for 10 wk leads to the activation of the inflammatory response, and decreases the anti-oxidant capacity, and subsequently impairs the mitochondrial function in the liver.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the postnatal and developmental changes in morphology, intercellular junctions and voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels in the intestine of piglets during the suckling and post-weaning periods.ResultsSamples of the small intestine were obtained from 1-, 7-, 14-, and 21-d-old suckling piglets and piglets on d 1, 3, 5, and 7 after weaning at 14 d of age. The results showed that the percentage of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, as well as the abundances of E-cadherin, occludin, and Kv1.5 mRNA and claudin-1, claudin-3, and occludin protein in the jejunum were increased from d 1 to d 21 during the suckling period (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

While there was an adaptive restoration on d 7 post-weaning, the measured values did not return to the pre-weaning levels, which reflected the impairment of intercellular junctions and Kv channels.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundColibacillosis caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) results in economic losses in the poultry industry. Antibiotics are usually used to control colibacillosis, however, E. coli has varying degrees of resistance to different antibiotics. Therefore the use of probiotics is becoming accepted as an alternative to antibiotics. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Clostridium butyricum (C. butyricum) on growth performance, immune response, intestinal barrier function, and digestive enzyme activity in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli (E. coli) K88.MethodsThe chickens were randomly divided into four treatment groups for 28\\xa0days. Negative control treatment (NC) consisted of birds fed a basal diet without E. coli K88 challenge and positive control treatment (PC) consisted of birds fed a basal diet and challenged with E. coli K88. C. butyricum probiotic treatment (CB) consisted of birds fed a diet containing 2\\u2009×\\u2009107\\xa0cfu C. butyricum/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88. Colistin sulfate antibiotic treatment (CS) consisted of birds fed a diet containing 20\\xa0mg colistin sulfate/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88.ResultsThe body weight (BW) and average day gain (ADG) in the broilers of CB group were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than the broilers in the PC group overall except the ADG in the 14-21 d post-challenge. The birds in CB treatment had higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) at 3 and 7 d post-challenge, and higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentration of interleukin-4 (IL-4) at 14 d post-challenge than those in the PC treatment group. The concentration of serum endotoxin in CB birds was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) at 21 d post-challenge, and the concentrations of serum diamine oxidase in CB birds were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) at 14 and 21 d post-challenge than in PC birds. Birds in CB treatment group had higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) jejunum villi height than those in PC, NC, or CS treatment at 7, 14, and 21 d post-challenge. In comparison to PC birds, the CB birds had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) jejunum crypt depth during the whole experiment. The birds in CB or CS treatment group had higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) activities of amylase and protease at 3, 7, and 14 d post-challenge, and higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) activity of lipase at 3, 7 d post-challenge than PC birds.ConclusionsIn all, these results indicate that dietary supplementation with C. butyricum promotes immune response, improves intestinal barrier function, and digestive enzyme activities in broiler chickens challenged with E. coli K88. There is no significant difference between the C. butyricum probiotic treatment and the colistin sulfate antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the C. butyricum probiotic may be an alternative to antibiotic for broiler chickens.',\n",

However, limited information is available for duck breeders. In this study, a total of 1,560 Cherry Valley SM3 duck breeder females and 312 males were used to assess if the addition of CX and 25-OH-D3 could increase the performance of duck breeders under two different dietary vitamin regimens. Four diets were used under a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement with 2 kinds of vitamin premixes (REGULAR and HIGH; HIGH premix had higher levels of all vitamins except K3 than REGULAR premix), and with or without the supplementation of the mixture of CX (6\\xa0mg/kg) and 25-OH-D3 (0.069\\xa0mg/kg). The ducks were fed ad libitum with pelleted diets based on corn-soybean meal from 38 to 77 wk of age.ResultsHIGH vitamin premix decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) of egg yolk, increased hatchability of fertile eggs (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029), increased hatchability of total eggs (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029), and decreased serum protein carbonyl level (P\\u2009=\\u20090.037) of breeder males. The mixture of CX and 25-OH-D3 increased serum calcium of breeder females (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010), decreased the cracked egg rate (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), increased the pigmentation of egg yolk (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and male bill (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and decreased MDA level of egg yolk (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and male serum (P\\u2009=\\u20090.034). Interactive effects were observed in cracked egg rate (P\\u2009=\\u20090.038), shell thickness (P\\u2009=\\u20090.011) and serum phosphorus (P\\u2009=\\u20090.026) of breeder females. HIGH vitamin premix together with the mixture of CX and 25-OH-D3 decreased cracked egg rate and increased shell thickness of duck breeders. Serum phosphorus was decreased in duck breeder females fed REGULAR vitamin premix without the addition of the CX and 25-OH-D3 mixture.ConclusionsDietary HIGH vitamin premix increased antioxidant status of eggs and breeder males, and increased hatchability. The mixture of CX and 25-OH-D3 enhanced egg shell quality, and promoted pigmentation and antioxidant status of eggs and breeder males.',\n",

In experiment 2, six ewes (65.2\\u2009±\\u20092.0\\xa0kg BW) with ruminal canulas were assigned to the same two dietary treatments as in experiment 1 for 42\\xa0days to investigate supplementary AL on ruminal fermentation and microbial flora. The methane emissions were determined using an open-circuit respirometry system and microbial assessment was done by qPCR of 16S rRNA genes.ResultsSupplementary AL increased the apparent digestibility of organic matter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), nitrogen (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006), neutral detergent fiber (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and acid detergent fiber (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002). Fecal nitrogen output was reduced (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) but urinary nitrogen output was unaffected (P\\u2009=\\u20090.691), while nitrogen retention (P\\u2009=\\u20090.077) and nitrogen retention/nitrogen intake (P\\u2009=\\u20090.077) tended to increase. Supplementary AL decreased methane emissions scaled to metabolic bodyweight by 5.95\\xa0% (P\\u2009=\\u20090.007) and to digestible organic matter intake by 8.36\\xa0% (P\\u2009=\\u20090.009). Ruminal pH was unaffected (P\\u2009=\\u20090.601) while ammonia decreased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.024) and total volatile fatty acids increased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.024) in response to supplementary AL. Supplementary AL decreased the population of methanogens (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and tended to decrease that of protozoans (P\\u2009=\\u20090.097), but increased the populations of F. succinogenes (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), R. flavefaciens (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), and B. fibrisolvens (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001).ConclusionsSupplementation of AL at 2.0\\xa0g/head·day effectively enhanced OM, N, NDF, and ADF digestibility and reduced daily methane emissions (L/kg BW0.75) in ewes, probably by decreasing the population of ruminal protozoans and methanogens.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn Sus scrofa, methionine sulfoxide reductase B3 (MSRB3) is a crucial candidate gene for ear size, and an important conformational trait of pig breeds. However, challenges in MSRB3 cDNA amplification have prevented further identification of MSRB3 allelic variants influencing pig ear size.ResultsWe cloned a full-length cDNA sequence of porcine MSRB3 by rapid-amplification of cDNA ends. The 3,765-bp gene contained a 5’-untranslated region (UTR) (190\\xa0bp), a coding region (552\\xa0bp), and a 3’-UTR (3,016\\xa0bp) and shared 84\\xa0%, 84\\xa0%, 87\\xa0%, 86\\xa0%, and 70\\xa0% sequence identities with human, orangutan, mouse, chicken, and zebrafish, respectively. The gene encoded a 183-amino acid protein, which shared 88\\xa0%, 91\\xa0%, 89\\xa0%, 86\\xa0%, and 67\\xa0% identities with human, orangutan, mouse, chicken, and zebrafish, respectively. Tissue expression analysis using qRT-PCR revealed that MSRB3 was expressed in the heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, ear, muscle, fat, lymph, skeletal, and hypothalamic tissues. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in MSRB3: c.-735C\\u2009>\\u2009T in the 5’ flanking region, c.2571\\xa0T\\u2009>\\u2009C in the 3’-UTR, and a synonymous mutation of c.484\\xa0T\\u2009>\\u2009C in the coding region. The SNPs c.-735C\\u2009>\\u2009T and c.2571\\xa0T\\u2009>\\u2009C were significantly associated with ear size in a Large White\\u2009×\\u2009Minzhu F2 population other than in Beijing Black pigs. Subsequently, at SNP c.-735C\\u2009>\\u2009T, the mRNA of MSRB3 was significantly higher expressed in ears of individuals with the TT genotype (Minzhu) than those with CC (Large White).ConclusionsThe porcine MSRB3 owned a 3,765-bp full-length cDNA sequence and was detected to express in ear tissue. Two SNPs of this gene were shown to be significantly associated with ear size in a Large White\\u2009×\\u2009Minzhu intercross population instead of Beijing\\xa0Black pig population. What’s more, the individuals with higher mRNA expression of MSRB3 have larger ear sizes. These results provide useful information for further functional analyses of MSRB3 influencing ear size in pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundMale germline stem cells (MGSCs) are a subpopulation of germ cells in the testis tissue. MGSCs are capable of differentiation into spermatozoa and thus are perfect targets for genomic manipulation to generate transgenic animals.MethodThe present study was to optimize a protocol of production of transgenic mice through transduction of MGSCs in vivo using lentiviral-based vectors. The recombinant lentiviral vectors with either EF-1 or CMV promoter to drive the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgene were injected into seminiferous tubules or inter-tubular space of 7-day-old and 28-day-old mouse testes. At 5 or 6 wk post-surgery, these pre-founders were mated with wild-type C57BL/6J female mice (1.5 to 2.0-month-old).ResultsSixty-seven percent of F1 generation and 55.56\\xa0% of F2 offspring were positive for eGFP transgene under the control of EF-1 promoter via PCR analysis. The transgenic pups were generated in an injection site-and age-independent manner. The expression of transgene was displayed in the progeny derived from lentiviral vector containing CMV promoter to drive transgene, but it was silenced or undetectable in the offspring derived from lentiviral vector with transgene under EF-1 promoter. The methylation level of gDNA in the promoter region of transgene was much higher in the samples derived lentiviral vectors with EF-1 promoter than that with CMV promoter, suggesting eGFP transgene was suppressed by DNA methylation in vivo.ConclusionThis research reported here an effective strategy for generation of transgenic mice through transduction of MGSCs in vivo using lentivirus vectors with specific promoters, and the transgenic offspring were obtained in an injection site-and age-independent manner. This protocol could be applied to other animal species, leading to advancement of animal transgenesis in agricultural and biomedical fields.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe positive influence of replacing dietary starch with sugar on milk fat production has been proposed to be partially attributed to the inhibition of the rumen trans-10 biohydrogenation pathway. However, whether and how sucrose inhibits the rumen trans-10 biohydrogenation pathway remains elusive.ResultsA batch in vitro incubation system was used to evaluate effects of replacing cornstarch in a high-concentrate diet (forage to concentrate ratio\\u2009=\\u200940:60) with 0 (control), 3, 6 and 9\\xa0% of sucrose on rumen fermentation pattern, fatty acid (FA) biohydrogenation pathways and bacterial populations relating to trans-11 to trans-10 biohydrogenation pathways. Replacing dietary cornstarch with sucrose did not alter rumen pH or concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) in comparison with the control but significantly influenced the profiles of individual VFA. The molar proportions of butyrate and valerate were linearly increased, while that of acetate was quadratically decreased and those of propionate, isobutyrate and isovalerate were linearly decreased with increasing concentrations of sucrose in the diet. Furthermore, replacing cornstarch with sucrose led to a linear decrease in C18:1 trans-10, linear increases in the proportions of C18:1 trans-11, C18:2n-6 and the ratio of trans-11 to trans-10, and linear decreases in biohydrogenation of C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3. The abundance of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, a butyrate and CLA cis-9, trans-11 producer, was increased with the increasing inclusion of sucrose in the diet, while the population of Megasphaera elsdenii, a CLA trans-10, cis-12 producer, was significantly decreased by all levels of sucrose replacements.ConclusionsThese results indicate that replacing starch in a high-concentrate diet with sucrose increased butyrate production and inhibited the rumen trans-10 biohydrogenation pathway, which was at least partially due to increased abundance of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and decreased abundance of Megasphaera elsdenii.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn the post-antibiotic era, essential oils (EO) are promising alternatives to growth-promoting antibiotics. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of an EO product and its components thymol and carvacrol in vitro, and the efficacy of EO to control Clostridium perfringens challenge in broiler chickens.ResultsThe in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration assay showed strong antibacterial activity of the EO product, thymol, and carvacrol against pathogenic Escherichia coli, C. perfringens, and Salmonella strains, and weak activity towards beneficial Lactobacillus strains. Besides, an additive effect was observed between thymol and carvacrol. The in vivo study was carried out with 448 male broiler chicks following a 4\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement to test the effects of EO supplementation (0, 60, 120, or 240\\xa0mg/kg EO in wheat-based diet), pathogen challenge (with or without oral gavage of C. perfringens from day 14 to day 20) and their interactions. Each treatment consisted of eight replicate pens (seven birds/pen). The challenge led to macroscopic gut lesions, and resulted in a significant increase in ileal populations of C. perfringens and Escherichia subgroup (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05) on day 21. Dietary EO supplementation did not influence C. perfringens numbers, but linearly alleviated intestinal lesions on day 21 and 28 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010 and 0.036, respectively), and decreased Escherichia populations in ileum with increased EO dosages (P\\u2009=\\u20090.027 and 0.071 for day 21 and 28, respectively). For caecum, EO quadratically influenced Lactobacillus populations on day 21 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002), and linearly decreased the numbers of total bacteria and Escherichia on day 28 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.026 and 0.060, respectively). Mean thymol and carvacrol concentrations in the small intestine were 0.21 and 0.20\\xa0μg/g in intestinal digesta (wet weight), respectively, for birds fed 60\\xa0mg/kg EO, and 0.80 and 0.71\\xa0μg/g, respectively, for birds fed 240\\xa0mg/kg EO.ConclusionsThese results indicated that dietary EO supplementation could affect intestinal microbiota and alleviate intestinal lesions in broilers, which may contribute in controlling C. perfringens infection in broiler chickens.',\n",
       " 'High fiber co-products from the copra and palm kernel industries are by-products of the production of coconut oil and palm kernel oil. The co-products include copra meal, copra expellers, palm kernel meal, and palm kernel expellers. All 4 ingredients are very high in fiber and the energy value is relatively low when fed to pigs. The protein concentration is between 14 and 22\\xa0% and the protein has a low biological value and a very high Arg:Lys ratio. Digestibility of most amino acids is less than in soybean meal but close to that in corn. However, the digestibility of Lys is sometimes low due to Maillard reactions that are initiated due to overheating during drying. Copra and palm kernel ingredients contain 0.5 to 0.6\\xa0% P. Most of the P in palm kernel meal and palm kernel expellers is bound to phytate, but in copra products less than one third of the P is bound to phytate. The digestibility of P is, therefore, greater in copra meal and copra expellers than in palm kernel ingredients. Inclusion of copra meal should be less than 15\\xa0% in diets fed to weanling pigs and less than 25\\xa0% in diets for growing-finishing pigs. Palm kernel meal may be included by 15\\xa0% in diets for weanling pigs and 25\\xa0% in diets for growing and finishing pigs.Rice bran contains the pericarp and aleurone layers of brown rice that is removed before polished rice is produced. Rice bran contains approximately 25\\xa0% neutral detergent fiber and 25 to 30\\xa0% starch. Rice bran has a greater concentration of P than most other plant ingredients, but 75 to 90\\xa0% of the P is bound in phytate. Inclusion of microbial phytase in the diets is, therefore, necessary if rice bran is used. Rice bran may contain 15 to 24\\xa0% fat, but it may also have been defatted in which case the fat concentration is less than 5\\xa0%. Concentrations of digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) are slightly less in full fat rice bran than in corn, but defatted rice bran contains less than 75\\xa0% of the DE and ME in corn. The concentration of crude protein is 15 to 18\\xa0% in rice bran and the protein has a high biological value and most amino acids are well digested by pigs. Inclusion of rice bran in diets fed to pigs has yielded variable results and based on current research it is recommended that inclusion levels are less than 25 to 30\\xa0% in diets for growing-finishing pigs, and less than 20\\xa0% in diets for weanling pigs. However, there is a need for additional research to determine the inclusion rates that may be used for both full fat and defatted rice bran.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundCYP11A1, a gene belonging to the family 11 of cytochrome P450, encodes a crucial steroidogenic enzyme that catalyzes the initial step in the production of all classes of steroids. Many studies show that CYP11A1 plays a role in ovary function. However, the role of CYP11A1 in goose reproductive cycle remains largely unknown.ResultsIn this study, full-length CYP11A1 cDNA of Zhedong goose was obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA consisted of a 96-base pair (bp) 5′untranslated region (UTR), a 179-bp 3′UTR and a 1509-bp open reading frame. The open reading frame encodes a putative 503 amino acid protein that shares high homology with CYP11A1 of other birds. The amino acid sequence possesses conserved domains of the P450 superfamily, which include the steroid-binding domain and the heme-binding region. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed CYP11A1 mRNA was expressed ubiquitously in every Zhedong goose tissue analyzed, including the heart, liver, glandular stomach, lung, spleen, kidney, intestinum tenue, intestinum crassum, cerebrum, cerebellum, muscle, oviduct, pituitary, hypothalamus and ovary.. The relatively low levels of CYP11A1 mRNA were detected in pituitary, ovary and oviduct tissues at ovulation when compared with levels at oviposition. Interestingly, higher expression was observed in ovary and oviduct tissues during brooding. Lastly, higher mRNA expression of Yangzhou geese was detected during the ovulation period than that of Zhedong geese.ConclusionsOur findings reveal the sequence characterization and expression patterns of the CYP11A1 gene during the goose reproductive cycle, which may provides correlative evidence that CYP11A1 expression is important in reproduction activity.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIdentification of genetic variants, including SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), CNVs (Copy Number Variations) and alternative splicing, within functional genes has received increasing attention in animal science research. HGF (Hepatocyte Growth Factor) is a very important growth factor that works as a mitogen or a morphogen during tissue growth, development and regeneration. However, to date, the functions of genetic variants within the bovine HGF gene, particularly their effects on mRNA expression, have not been determined well.ResultsThe present study aimed to perform association analysis between genetic variants and mRNA expression for the bovine HGF gene in Qinchuan cattle using various strategies, including PCR-RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), qPCR (Quantitative Real-time quantitative PCR), TA cloning, DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. A total of five SNPs were identified and only SV1 locus significantly affected HGF mRNA expression in fetal skeletal muscle (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Heterozygous genotype individuals showed significantly higher HGF expression (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), which was significantly greater in the “CTCCAGGGTT” combined genotype than that in the “CCCCGGGGTT” combined genotype (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, two alternative splicing variations, HGF-W and HGF-M, were identified, which resulted from alternative 3′ splice sites of exon 5, and HGF-W showed higher mRNA levels than HGF-M in all tissues.ConclusionIn summary, genetic variations within the HGF gene affected mRNA expression. These findings provide new insight into the molecular characteristics and functions of bovine HGF.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to investigate how inclusion of chicory forage or ribwort forage in a cereal-based diet influenced the fecal microbial community (microbiome) in newly weaned (35\\xa0days of age) piglets. The piglets were fed a cereal-based diet without (B) and with inclusion (80 and 160\\xa0g/kg air-dry forage) of vegetative shoots of chicory (C) and leaves of ribwort (R) forage in a 35-day growth trial. Fecal samples were collected at the start (D0), 17 (D17) and 35 (D35) days after weaning and profiles of the microbial consortia were generated using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). 454-FLX pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was used to analyze the microbial composition in a subset of the samples already analyzed with T-RFLP.ResultsThe microbial clustering pattern was primarily dependent on age of the pigs, but diet effects could also be observed. Lactobacilli and enterobacteria were more abundant at D0, whereas the genera Streptococcus, Treponema, Clostridium, Clostridiaceae1 and Coprococcus were present in higher abundances at D35. Pigs fed ribwort had an increased abundance of sequences classified as Treponema and a reduction in lactobacilli. However, the abundance of Prevotellaceae increased with age in on both the chicory and the ribwort diet. Moreover, there were significant correlations between the abundance of Bacteroides and the digested amount of galactose, uronic acids and total non-starch polysaccharides, and between the abundance of Bacteroidales and the digested amount of xylose.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that both chicory and ribwort inclusion in the diet of newly weaned pigs influenced the composition of the fecal microbiota and that digestion of specific dietary components was correlated with species composition of the microbiota. Moreover, this study showed that the gut will be exposed to a dramatic shift in the microbial community structure several weeks after weaning.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe current study was carried out to determine effects of dietary protein source and crude protein (CP) level on carcass characteristics, meat quality, and muscle amino acid (AA) profile in finishing gilts. The experiment was designed as a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement with two sources of dietary proteins (cottonseed meal, CSM vs. soybean meal, SBM) and two levels of CP (12\\xa0% vs. 14\\xa0%, as-fed basis). Seventy-two crossbred gilts (89.5\\u2009±\\u20090.9\\xa0kg) were allotted to one of four dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design for a period of 28 d. All diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and similar concentrations of standardized ileal digestible essential AA covering the nutrient requirements of pigs.ResultsGrowth, carcass characteristics and meat quality were not affected by dietary protein source nor crude protein level (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) except that average daily feed intake was increased by CSM diets (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03). Gilts offered reduced protein diets had lower muscle pH45min (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Neither dietary protein source nor crude protein level influenced N deposition. However, reduced protein diets decreased N intake, N excretion, and serum urea nitrogen content, whilst improved N efficiency (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). CSM diets increased N intake (P\\u2009=\\u20090.04), but did not depress N efficiency. The concentrations of phenylalanine, tryptophan, cysteine and tyrosine (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) of the longissimus muscle were decreased when gilts offered CSM diets, while muscle intracellular free valine concentration was increased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03). The gilts offered reduced protein diets had greater intracellular concentrations of free methionine, lysine, and total AA in muscle (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionThese results suggest that CSM could replace SBM as a primary protein source in finishing pig diets in terms of performance, N efficiency, carcass characteristics, and meat quality, but decrease the concentrations of muscle specific AA. Furthermore, the reduced protein diet played an important role in increasing muscle intracellular concentrations of specific free amino acids (FAA), and in reducing the relative ratios of specific FAA to lysine in longissimus dorsi muscle of pig, whose biological meaning needs further studies.',\n",

Nonetheless, enhancing the unsaturated fatty acid content of ruminant meat can have adverse effects on the shelf life and quality attributes of the meat. This study assessed the effects of dietary 80\\xa0% canola oil and 20\\xa0% palm oil blend (CPOB) on fatty acid composition, antioxidants, oxidative spoilage, cholesterol and physicochemical properties of semimembranosus (SM) muscle from goats. Twenty four Boer bucks were randomly assigned to diets containing on dry matter basis 0, 4 and 8\\xa0% CPOB, fed for 100 d and slaughtered.

The muscle glycogen, pH, water holding capacity, tenderness, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, total carotenoid, δ-tocopherol, cholesterol and proximate composition did not differ (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) between diets. The SM muscle from goats fed 4 and 8\\xa0% CPOB had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentration of C14:0 and C16:0 and higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentration of C18:1 trans-11, C18:1ω-9, C18:3ω-3, C20:5ω-3 and C22:5ω-3 than the SM muscle from the control goats. Dietary CPOB increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) the concentration of α and γ tocopherol and meat redness (a*) on d 1 and 4 postmortem. Regardless of diet, antioxidant vitamins, and shear force decreased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) while drip loss, lipid and protein oxidation increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) as postmortem storage progressed.ConclusionResults evince that dietary CPOB can be used as a management tool to enhance the beneficial fatty acids and antioxidant contents of chevon without deleterious effects on its physicochemical properties and shelf life.',\n",
       " 'Early equine pregnancy shares many features with that of more intensively assessed domestic animals species, but there are also characteristic differences. Some of those are poorly understood. Descent of the equine conceptus into the uterine lumen occurs at day 5 to 6 after ovulation but is only possible when the embryo secretes prostaglandin E2. Although maintenance of equine pregnancy probably involves secretion of a conceptus derived anti-luteolytic factor, this agent has not been identified. Rapid growth, conceptus mobility and presence of an acellular capsule at the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy, i.e. between days 12 and 14, are prerequisites to avoid pregnancy loss. Progesterone together with 5α-pregnanes is secreted by the corpus luteum and induces the production of endometrial histotroph which is responsible for conceptus nutrition until placention. A stable contact between the outer trophoblast layer of the allantochorion and the luminal epithelium of the endometrium is not established before days 40 to 42 of pregnancy.',\n",

However, there is no previous research on nucleotide supplementation in weanling pigs under an oral challenged E. coli K88. Therefore, 2 experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of dietary nucleotides on weanling pig growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal score, and blood profile after being orally challenged with E. coli K88.MethodsIn Exp. 1, a total of 140 weanling pigs [8.33\\u2009±\\u20090.33\\xa0kg of body weight (BW), 28-d old] were used in this 42-d feeding trial. Pigs were distributed into 1 of 4 treatments, 5 pigs/pen (3 barrows and 2 gilts) and 7 pens/treatment. Treatments were a control basal diet (CON) or the CON supplemented with 150 (R150), 220 (R220), or 275 (R275) mg/kg to give the three treatment diets. In Exp. 2, 28 weanling pigs (BW\\u2009=\\u20098.40\\u2009±\\u20090.22\\xa0kg, 28-d old) were distributed into 1 of 4 treatments to give 1 pig/pen and 7 pens/treatment in a 42-d feeding and challenge trial.

On d 14, all those pigs (BW\\u2009=\\u200913.3\\u2009±\\u20090.15\\xa0kg, 42-d old) were orally dosed with 1.5\\xa0mL suspension containing 1010\\xa0cfu/mL of E. coli K88. Twenty four hours after challenge, blood and excreta samples were collected from each pigs for analysis. Fecal scores were measured on d 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the study.ResultsIn Exp. 1, overall BW, average daily gain (ADG), gain/feed (G/F) ratio, and nutrient digestibilities were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in CON group compared with the nucleotides fed pigs. In Exp. 2, after challenge, IgA, IgM, and IGF-I were higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the nucleotide groups compared with CON. However, the nucleotide groups had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) cortisol and TNF-α compared with CON. Fecal E. coli counts and fecal score for the nucleotide groups were lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than for CON.ConclusionsIn conclusion, dietary nucleotides supplementation could improve growth performance, nutrient digestibility, immune status, microbial balance, reduce diarrhea, and provide protection against enterotoxigenic E. coli K88 infection in weanling pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe redox status of intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) piglets post-weaning has been poorly studied.MethodsNewborns from twenty-four sows were weighted, weaned at 21 d and fed a starter diet until sampling. Sampling was done at 14 d post-weaning. A piglet was defined as IUGR when its birth weight was 2 SD below the mean birth weight of the total population. At weaning, eighteen piglets with nearly equal body weight from each category (i.e. IUGR or normal birth weight (NBW) piglets) were selected and then allocated to two treatments, consisted of six replicates with each pen having three piglets.ResultsCompared with NBW group, IUGR significantly decreased average daily gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), average daily feed intake (P\\u2009=\\u20090.003), and feed efficiency (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) of piglets during the first two weeks post-weaning. IUGR decreased the activities of total antioxidant capacity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.019), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD, P\\u2009=\\u20090.023), and ceruloplasmin (P\\u2009=\\u20090.044) but increased the levels of malondialdehyde (P\\u2009=\\u20090.040) and protein carbonyl (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010) in plasma. Similarly, the decreased activities of T-SOD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.005), copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD, P\\u2009=\\u20090.002), and catalase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.049) was observed in the liver of IUGR piglets than these of NBW piglets. IUGR decreased hepatic Cu/Zn-SOD activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.023) per unit of Cu/Zn-SOD protein in piglets when compared with NBW piglets. In addition, IUGR piglets exhibited the decreases in accumulation of copper in both plasma (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and liver (P\\u2009=\\u20090.014), as well as the concentrations of iron (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002) and zinc (P\\u2009=\\u20090.048) in liver. Compared with NBW, IUGR down-regulated mRNA expression of Cu/Zn-SOD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.021) in the liver of piglets.ConclusionsThe results indicated that IUGR impaired antioxidant capacity and resulted in oxidative damage in fully weaned piglets, which might be associated with the decreased levels of redox-active trace minerals. This study highlights the importance of redox status in IUGR offspring and provides a rationale for alleviating oxidative damage by dietary interventions aiming to supplement trace minerals and to restore redox balance in the future.',\n",
       " 'The present study was conducted to determine effects of different forms of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain Y200007) on the growth performance, intestinal development, and systemic immunity in early-weaned piglets. A total of 96 piglets (14-d old, initial average body weight of 4.5\\xa0kg) were assigned to 4 dietary treatments: (1) basal diet without yeast (Control); (2) basal diet supplemented with 3.00\\xa0g/kg live yeast (LY); (3) basal diet supplemented with 2.66\\xa0g/kg heat-killed whole yeast (HKY); and (4) basal diet supplemented with 3.00\\xa0g/kg superfine yeast powders (SFY). Diets and water were provided ad libitum to the piglets during 3-week experiment. Growth performance of piglets was measured weekly. Samples of blood and small intestine were collected at days 7 and 21 of experiment. Dietary supplementation with LY and SFY improved G:F of piglets at days 1-21 of the experiment (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared to Control group. Serum concentrations of growth hormone (GH), triiodothyronine (T3), tetraiodothyronine (T4), and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in piglets at day 21 of the experiment were higher when fed diets supplemented with LY and SFY than those in Control group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Compared to Control group, contents of serum urea nitrogen of piglets were reduced by the 3 yeast-supplemented diets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Diets supplemented with LY increased villus height and villus-to-crypt ratio in duodenum and jejunum of piglets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared to other two groups at day 7 of the experiment. Feeding diets supplemented with LY and SFY increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) serum concentrations of IgA, IL-2, and IL-6 levels in piglets compared to Control. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio and proliferation of T-lymphocytes in piglets fed diets supplemented with LY were increased compared to that of Control group at day 7 of the experiment (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with both LY and SFY enhanced feed conversion, small intestinal development, and systemic immunity in early-weaned piglets, with better improvement in feed conversion by dietary supplementation with LY, while dietary supplementation with SFY was more effective in increasing systemic immune functions in early-weaned piglets.',\n",
       " 'This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of increased atmospheric temperature and CO2 concentration during crop growth on the chemical composition and in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics of wheat straw. The field experiment was carried out from November 2012 to June 2013 at Changshu (31°32′93″N, 120°41′88″E) agro-ecological experimental station. A total of three treatments were set. The concentration of CO2 was increased to 500\\xa0μmol/mol in the first treatment (CO2 group). The temperature was increased by 2\\xa0°C in the second treatment (TEM group) and the concentration of CO2 and temperature were both increased in the third treatment (CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM group). The mean temperature and concentration of CO2 in control group were 10.5\\xa0°C and 413\\xa0μmol/mol. At harvesting, the wheat straws were collected and analyzed for chemical composition and in vitro digestibility. Results showed that dry matter was significantly increased in all three treatments. Ether extracts and neutral detergent fiber were significantly increased in TEM and CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM groups. Crude protein was significantly decreased in CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM group. In vitro digestibility analysis of wheat straw revealed that gas production was significantly decreased in CO2 and CO2\\u2009+\\u2009TEM groups.

       " 'Animal production depends on nutrient utilization and if done there is an accelerated momentum towards growth with a low cost to feed ratio Public concern over the consumption of pork with antibiotic residues of the animals fed with antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) has paved the way to use other additives like herbs and their products, probiotics, prebiotics etc. Numerous feed additives are in vogue for achieving this target and one such classical example is the usage of organic acids and their salts. Usage of organic acids was in progress for over four decades. Early weaned piglets are (3–4\\xa0weeks age) exposed to stress with a reduced feed intake, little or no weight gain. This post weaning lag period is due to a limited digestive and absorptive capacity due to insufficient production of hydrochloric acid, pancreatic enzymes and sudden changes in feed consistency and intake. Lowering dietary pH by weak organic acids was found to overcome these problems. The main activity of organic acids is associated with a reduction in gastric pH converting the inactive pepsinogen to active pepsin for effective protein hydrolysis. Organic acids are both bacteriostatic and bactericidal. Lactic acid has been reported to reduce gastric pH and delay the multiplication of an enterotoxigenic E. coli. These acids are the intermediary products in Kreb’s cycle and thus act as an energy source preventing the tissue breakdown resulting from gluconeogenesis and lipolysis. Excretion of supplemental minerals and nitrogen are minimized with organic acids as these form complexes with minerals and aids for their bio-availability. Short chain fatty cids like acetic, propionic and n-butyric acid produced by microbial fermentation of dietary fibre in the large intestines may increase the proliferation of epithelial cells and have stimulatory effects on both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic secretions in pigs. Organic acids also enhances apparent total tract digestibility and improves growth performance. It is concluded that organic acids and their salts increase the protein utilization especially in weaner pigs and improves production indices.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundCytoplasmic injection of exogenous DNA into zygotes is a promising technique to generate transgenic livestock. However, it is still relatively inefficient and has not yet been demonstrated to work in buffalo. We sought to improve two key technical parameters of the procedure, namely i) how much linear DNA to inject and ii) when to inject it. For this, we introduced a constitutively expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid into buffalo zygotes.ResultsFirst, we found that the proportion of EGFP-expressing blastocysts derived from zygotes injected with 20 or 50\\xa0ng/μL DNA was significantly higher than from those injected with 5\\xa0μg/mL. However, 50\\xa0ng/μL exogenous DNA compromised blastocyst development compared to non-injected IVF controls. Therefore the highest net yield of EGFP-positive blastocysts was achieved at 20\\xa0ng/μL DNA. Second, zygotes injected early (7–8 h post-insemination [hpi]) developed better than those injected at mid (12–13 hpi) or late (18–19 hpi) time points. Blastocysts derived from early injections were also more frequently EGFP-positive. As a consequence, the net yield of EGFP-expressing blastocysts was more than doubled using early vs late injections (16.4\\xa0% vs 7.7\\xa0%). With respect to blastocyst quality, we found no significant difference in cell numbers of EGFP-positive blastocysts vs non-injected blastocysts. Following embryo transfer of six EGFP-positive blastocysts into four recipient animals, two viable buffalo calves were born. Biopsied ear tissues from both buffalo calves were analyzed for transgene presence and expression by Southern blot, PCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy, respectively. This confirmed that both calves were transgenic.ConclusionsOur cytoplasmic injection protocol improved generation of transgenic embryos and resulted in the first transgenic buffalo calves produced by this method.',\n",
       " 'Handmade cloning (HMC) is the most awaited, simple and micromanipulator-free version of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). The requirement of expensive micromanipulators and skilled expertise is eliminated in this technique, proving it as a major revolution in the field of embryology. During the past years, many modifications have been incorporated in this technique to boost its efficiency. This alternative approach to micromanipulator based traditional cloning (TC) works wonder in generating comparable or even higher birth rates in addition to declining costs drastically and enabling cryopreservation. This technique is not only applicable to intraspecies nuclear transfer but also to interspecies nuclear transfer (iSCNT) thus permitting conservation of endangered species. It also offers unique possibilities for automation of SCNT which aims at production of transgenic animals that can cure certain human diseases by producing therapeutics hence, providing a healthier future for the wellbeing of humans. The present review aims at highlighting certain aspects of HMC including recent advancements in procedure and factors involved in elevating its efficiency besides covering the potentials and pitfalls of this technique.',\n",

After warming, they were cultured for 1\\xa0h in M2 medium containing melatonin at different concentrations (0, 10−9, 10−7, 10−5, 10−3\\xa0mol/L). Then the oocytes were used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels (fluorescence microscopy), and the developmental potential after parthenogenetic activation. The experimental results showed that the ROS level and cleavage rate in 10−3\\xa0mol/L melatonin group was significantly lower than that in melatonin-free group (control). The GSH levels and blastocyst rates in all melatonin-treated groups were similar to that in control. Based on the above results, we detected the expression of gene Hsp90aa1, Hsf1, Hspa1b, Nrf2 and Bcl-x1 with qRT-PCR in oocytes treated with 10−7, or 10−3\\xa0mol/L melatonin and untreated control. After warming and culture for 1\\xa0h, the oocytes showed higher Hsp90aa1 expression in 10−7\\xa0mol/L melatonin-treated group than in the control (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05); the Hsf1, Hsp90aa1 and Bcl-x1 expression were significantly decreased in 10−3\\xa0mol/L melatonin-treated group when compared to the control. Based on the above results and previous research, we detected the development of vitrified-warmed oocytes treated with either 10−7 or 0\\xa0mol/L melatonin by in vitro fertilization. No difference was observed between them.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the supplementation of melatonin (10−9 to 10−3\\xa0mol/L) in culture medium and incubation for 1\\xa0h did not improve the subsequent developmental potential of vitrified-warmed mouse MII oocytes, even if there were alteration in gene expression.',\n",
       " 'The intestine is not only critical for nutrient digestion and absorption, but also is the largest immune organ in the body. However, in pig production, inflammation induced by numerous factors, such as pathogen infection and stresses (e.g., weaning), results in intestinal mucosal injury and dysfunction, and consequently results in poor growth of pigs. Dietary fatty acids not only play critical roles in energy homeostasis and cellular membrane composition, but also exert potent effects on intestinal development, immune function, and inflammatory response. Recent studies support potential therapeutic roles for specific fatty acids (short chain and medium chain fatty acids and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) in intestinal inflammation of pigs. Results of these new lines of work indicate trophic and cytoprotective effects of fatty acids on intestinal integrity in pigs. In this article, we review the effect of inflammation on intestinal structure and function, and the role of specific fatty acids on intestinal health of pigs, especially under inflammatory conditions.',\n",
       " 'In recent years, the use of in-feed antibiotics for growth and disease prevention in livestock production has been under severe scrutiny. The use and misuse of in-feed antibiotics has led to problems with drug residues in animal products and increased bacterial resistance. Chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) have attracted considerable attention as an alternative to antibiotics to maintain swine health and performance. Oral administration of IgY possesses many advantages over mammalian IgG such as cost-effectiveness, convenience and high yield. This review presents an overview of the potential to use IgY immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of swine diarrhea diseases and speculates on the future of IgY technology. Included are a review of the potential applications of IgY in the control of enteric infections of either bacterial or viral origin such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., rotavirus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.

This paper reviews the use of phages as an antimicrobial strategy for controlling critical pathogens including Salmonella and Escherichia coli with an emphasis on the application of phages for improving performance and nutrient digestibility in swine operations as well as in controlling zoonotic human diseases by reducing the bacterial load spread from pork products to humans through the meat.',\n",
       " 'Clays are crystalline, hydrated aluminosilicate molecules composed of alkali and alkaline earth cations along with small amounts of various other elements. The best-known are montmorillonite, smectite, illite, kaolinite, biotite and clinoptilolite. The molecules in these clays are arranged in three-dimensional structures creating internal voids and channels capable of trapping a wide variety of molecules. As a result of this structure, clay minerals are regarded as a simple and effective tool for the prevention of the negative effects of many toxic compounds. Dietary supplementation with clays has been shown to improve weight gain and feed conversion in pigs. Where improvements in performance have been noted, one of the most likely explanations for the improvement is the fact clays increase nutrient digestibility. Clays reduce the speed of passage of feed along the digestive tract which allows more time for digestion. Feeding clays also causes morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa such as an increase in villus height and an increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. These changes increase the surface area of the gastrointestinal tract thus increasing nutrient digestibility. Several studies have indicated that feeding clay reduces the incidence, severity and duration of diarrhea in pigs. The mechanism for the reduction in diarrhea is likely due to increases in the numbers of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus and decreases in Clostridia and E. coli in the small intestine of pigs fed clays. In addition, the numbers of pigs born alive and weaned, birth weight and weaning weight have been shown to be higher for sows fed clays. Several studies have indicated that clays can help mitigate the effects of mycotoxins. The aim of the present review is to focus on the various clays which have been given attention in recent research and to discuss their potential to improve pig performance.',\n",

And a precise understanding of the nutritional value of an ingredient is beneficial for the accurate diet formulation and reduction of feed costs. This study was conducted to determine the chemical composition, digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) content, and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) for growing pigs. Thirteen solvent-extracted double-low rapeseed meal (DLRSM) samples were obtained from the main double-low rapeseed producing areas in China.MethodsThe DE and ME contents of the 13 DLRSM samples were measured in growing pigs (six pigs per DLRSM sample, average initial body weight (BW)\\u2009=\\u200948.3\\xa0kg). The AID and SID of AA of 10 DLRSM samples were determined in 12 crossbred barrows (average initial BW\\u2009=\\u200935.3\\xa0kg) by using two 6\\u2009×\\u20096 Latin square designs. Each Latin square comprised one N-free diet and 5 DLRSM test diets.ResultsThe chemical composition of DLRSM varied among samples, and the coefficient of variation was greater than 10\\xa0% for ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), calcium (Ca), and total glucosinolates. The AA content of DLRSM varied among samples especially for lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met).

       " 'BackgroundThe protein/energy ratio is important for the production performance and utilization of available feed resources by animals. Increased protein consumption by mammals leads to elevated feed costs and increased nitrogen release into the environment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary protein/energy ratio on the growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and plasma metabolites of pigs of different genotypes.MethodsBama mini-pigs and Landrace pigs were randomly assigned to two dietary treatment groups (Chinese conventional diet with low protein/energy ratio or National Research Council diet with high protein/energy ratio; n\\u2009=\\u200924 per treatment) in a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement. Blood and muscle samples were collected at the end of the nursery, growing, and finishing phases.ResultsWe observed significant interactions (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) between breed and diet for total fat percentage, intramuscular fat (IMF) content, protein content in biceps femoris (BF) muscle, and plasma urea nitrogen (UN) concentration in the nursery phase; for average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), dry matter, IMF content in psoas major (PM) muscle, and plasma total protein and albumin concentrations in the growing phase; and for drip loss and plasma UN concentration in the finishing phase. Breed influenced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality, but not plasma metabolites. Throughout the trial, Landrace pigs showed significantly higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) ADG, ADFI, dressing percentage, lean mass rate, and loin-eye area than did Bama mini-pigs, but significantly lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) feed/gain ratio, fat percentage, backfat thickness, and IMF content. Dietary protein/energy ratio influenced the pH value, chemical composition of BF and PM muscles, and plasma activities of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and plasma concentration of UN.ConclusionsCompared with Landrace pigs, Bama mini-pigs showed slower growth and lower carcass performance, but had better meat quality. Moreover, unlike Landrace pigs, the dietary protein/energy ratio did not affect the growth performance of Bama mini-pigs. These results suggest that, in swine production, low dietary protein/energy ratio may be useful for reducing feed costs and minimizing the adverse effects of ammonia release into the environment.',\n",
       " 'Lysozyme is a naturally occurring enzyme found in bodily secretions such as tears, saliva, and milk. It functions as an antimicrobial agent by cleaving the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls, which leads to cell death. Antibiotics are also antimicrobials and have been fed at subtherapeutic levels to swine as growth promoters. These compounds benefit swine producers by minimizing production losses by increasing feed efficiency and decreasing susceptibility to bacterial infection and disease. This manuscript reviews the knowledge of the effects of lysozyme, as compared to traditional subtherapeutic antibiotics in swine feed, on pig performance and health. It is clear from decades of studies that antibiotic use in feeds increases pig performance, particularly in the nursery. Similarly, lysozyme, as a feed additive, increases growth and feed efficiency. While the mechanism by which antibiotics and lysozyme improve performance is not clearly understood, both of these feed additives improve gastrointestinal health, improve the metabolic profile, and alter the gastrointestinal bacteria ecology of swine. Therefore, lysozyme is a suitable alternative to growth-promoting subtherapeutic antibiotic use in swine feed.',\n",

       " 'Feed efficiency represents the cumulative efficiency with which the pig utilizes dietary nutrients for maintenance, lean gain and lipid accretion. It is closely linked with energy metabolism, as the oxidation of carbon-containing components in the feed drive all metabolic processes. While much is known about nutrient utilization and tissue metabolism, blending these subjects into a discussion on feed efficiency has proven to be difficult. For example, while increasing dietary energy concentration will almost certainly increase feed efficiency, the correlation between dietary energy concentration and feed efficiency is surprisingly low. This is likely due to the plethora of non-dietary factors that impact feed efficiency, such as the environment and health as well as individual variation in maintenance requirements, body composition and body weight.Nonetheless, a deeper understanding of feed efficiency is critical at many levels. To individual farms, it impacts profitability. To the pork industry, it represents its competitive position against other protein sources. To food economists, it means less demand on global feed resources. There are environmental and other societal implications as well.Interestingly, feed efficiency is not always reported simply as a ratio of body weight gain to feed consumed. This review will explain why this arithmetic calculation, as simple as it initially seems, and as universally applied as it is in science and commerce, can often be misleading due to errors inherent in recording of both weight gain and feed intake.This review discusses the importance of feed efficiency, the manner in which it can be measured and reported, its basis in biology and approaches to its improvement.

Furthermore, the response in milk cortisol levels was assessed during times of metabolic stress and pain associated symptoms of lameness.MethodsMilk yield and composition, blood serum glucose, NEFA and BHBA as well as milk cortisol were determined in 24 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows over the course of the first 22 weeks of lactation. Animals were further checked for signs of clinical diseases on a daily basis. Two feed restrictions over three days (FR; 70\\xa0% of precious ad libitum intake) were performed during the 4th wk and the 21st wk, respectively. An ELISA for cortisol measurement in easily accessible bovine skimmed milk was established and applied.ResultsOn the last day of FR in early lactation, a reduction in milk yield and changes in serum metabolites compared to respective previous values were detected. The FR in mid-lactation resulted in no changes in milk production and serum metabolites. Milk cortisol was highest during first wk of lactation and remained on comparable levels thereafter. Milk yield and composition were not influenced by FR. Lameness resulted in enhanced milk cortisol levels.ConclusionMilk cortisol could be used as an indicator of painful symptoms such as lameness.

Because lipids are a concentrated energy source, inclusion of lipids are known to affect growth rate and feed efficiency, but are also known to affect diet palatability, feed dustiness, and pellet quality. In reviewing the literature, the majority of research studies conducted on the subject of lipids have focused mainly on the effects of feeding presumably high quality lipids on growth performance, digestion, and metabolism in young animals. There is, however, the wide array of composition and quality differences among lipid sources available to the animal industry making it essential to understand differences in lipid composition and quality factors affecting their digestion and metabolism more fully. In addition there is often confusion in lipid nomenclature, measuring lipid content and composition, and evaluating quality factors necessary to understand the true feeding value to animals. Lastly, advances in understanding lipid digestion, post-absorption metabolism, and physiological processes (e.g., cell division and differentiation, immune function and inflammation); and in metabolic oxidative stress in the animal and lipid peroxidation, necessitates a more compressive assessment of factors affecting the value of lipid supplementation to livestock diets.

       " 'Since 1950, links between intake of saturated fatty acids and heart disease have led to recommendations to limit consumption of saturated fatty acid-rich foods, including beef. Over this time, changes in food consumption patterns in several countries including Canada and the USA have not led to improvements in health. Instead, the incidence of obesity, type II diabetes and associated diseases have reached epidemic proportions owing in part to replacement of dietary fat with refined carbohydrates. Despite the content of saturated fatty acids in beef, it is also rich in heart healthy cis-monounsaturated fatty acids, and can be an important source of long-chain omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in populations where little or no oily fish is consumed. Beef also contains polyunsaturated fatty acid biohydrogenation products, including vaccenic and rumenic acids, which have been shown to have anticarcinogenic and hypolipidemic properties in cell culture and animal models. Beef can be enriched with these beneficial fatty acids through manipulation of beef cattle diets, which is now more important than ever because of increasing public understanding of the relationships between diet and health.

Evaluation of environmental factors illustrated that wind and debris caused decreases in body surface temperatures without affecting metabolic rate; additionally, body surface temperature increased due to sunlight but returned to baseline values within minutes of shade exposure. Examination/investigation/exploration of animal factors demonstrated that exercise caused an increase in body surface temperature and metabolic rate.

The goal of this work is to measure the effects of tannins in ground pine bark as a partial feed replacement on feed intake, dietary apparent digestibility, nitrogen balance, and mineral retention in meat goats.ResultsEighteen Kiko cross goats (initial BW\\u2009=\\u200931.8\\u2009±\\u20091.49\\xa0kg) were randomly assigned to three treatment groups (n\\u2009=\\u20096). Dietary treatments were tested: control (0\\xa0% pine bark powder (PB) and 30\\xa0% wheat straw (WS)); 15\\xa0% PB and 15\\xa0% WS, and 30\\xa0% PB and 0\\xa0% WS. Although dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility were not affected (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10) by feeding PB, neutral detergent fiber (linear; P\\u2009=\\u20090.01), acid detergent fiber (linear; P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and lignin digestibility (linear; P\\u2009=\\u20090.01) decreased, and crude protein (CP) digestibility tended to decrease (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) as PB increased in the diet, apparent retention of Ca (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09), P (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03), Mg (P\\u2009=\\u20090.01), Mn (P\\u2009=\\u20090.01), Zn (P\\u2009=\\u20090.01) and Fe (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) also increased linearly. Nitrogen intake and fecal N excretion were not affected (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) by addition of PB in the diet, but N balance in the body was quadratically increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) in the 15\\xa0% PB diet compared to other diets. This may be due to more rumen escape protein and less excreted N in the urine with the 15\\xa0% PB diet. The study showed that a moderate level of tannin-containing pine bark supplementation could improve gastrointestinal nitrogen balance with the aim of improving animal performance.ConclusionThese results suggest that tannin-containing PB has negative impact on fiber, lignin, and protein digestibility, but positively impacted on N-balance.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe effect of time of fecal sampling on the accuracy of acid-detergent insoluble ash (ADIA) and alkaline-peroxide lignin (APL) for the prediction of fecal output (FO) in cattle was evaluated. Eight ruminally cannulated cows (594\\u2009±\\u200935.5\\xa0kg) were allocated randomly to 4 bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] hay diets markedly different in crude protein concentration (79–164\\xa0g/kg) with 2 replicates per diet for 3 periods. Cows were offered hay individually at 20\\xa0g DM/kg of body weight daily in equal feedings at 08:00 and 16:00\\xa0h for a 10-d adaptation period followed by 5-d of total fecal collection. Fecal grab samples also were taken each day during the fecal collection period at 06:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 24:00\\xa0h either directly from the rectum or from freshly voided feces. Samples were composited within cow and time across the 5 d total fecal collection period. Additionally, forage, ort, and fecal samples were analyzed for concentrations of APL and ADIA.ResultsFecal concentrations of ADIA and APL were not affected by sampling time (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.22), even though diet affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) fecal ADIA and APL concentrations. There were no diet\\u2009×\\u2009sampling time interactions (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.60). Estimates of FO and dry matter digestibility (DMD) from ADIA and APL were not affected (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.16) by sampling time or the diet\\u2009×\\u2009sampling time interaction (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.74). Estimates of FO and DMD from markers from different sampling times or all different combinations of sampling time were not different (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.72) from those of total collection among internal markers.ConclusionLittle variation in concentrations of ADIA and APL in daily fecal excretion across time increases flexibility in fecal grab sampling schedules for predicting FO and DMD.',\n",
       " 'Kisspeptin (Kp) is synthesized in the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area of the hypothalamus and is a regulator of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the hypothalamus. In addition, Kp may regulate additional functions such as increased neuropeptide Y gene expression and reduced proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression in sheep. Other studies have found a role for Kp to release growth hormone (GH), prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH) from cattle, rat and monkey pituitary cells. Intravenous injection of Kp stimulated release LH, GH, prolactin and follicle stimulating hormone in some experiments in cattle and sheep, but other studies have failed to find an effect of peripheral injection of Kp on GH release. Recent studies indicate that Kp can stimulate GH release after intracerebroventricular injection in sheep at doses that do not release GH after intravenous injection. These studies suggest that Kp may have a role in regulation of both reproduction and metabolism in sheep. Since GH plays a role in luteal development, it is tempting to speculate that the ability of Kp to release GH and LH is related to normal control of reproduction.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundExogenous melatonin could induce cashmere growth. However, induced growth of cashmere fleece by melatonin implants cannot be combined with the typical growth, resulting in earlier shedding followed by another cycle of cashmere growth. To address this issue, we examine the effects on the cashmere yield, fibre characteristics, and the growth and reproductive performance of cashmere goats of planned administration of melatonin.MethodsEighteen half-sib, female goats were assigned to two treatments (n\\u2009=\\u20099) including a control and a treatment where melatonin (2\\xa0mg/kg BW) was implanted at the end of April and end of June. Cashmere growth and shedding were observed for approximately 1\\xa0year following implantation. Fibre samples were collected monthly to determine cumulative cashmere length. Initiation and cessation dates for cashmere growth as well as the rate of cashmere growth were calculated. Cashmere yield, weight gain of dam, kidding date, litter size, and birth weight were also recorded.ResultsMelatonin implantation increased cashmere yield by 34.5\\xa0% (control 553.7\\xa0g vs. melatonin 745.0\\xa0g; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), cashmere length by 21.3\\xa0% (control 95.2\\xa0mm vs. melatonin 115.4\\xa0mm; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), and decreased fibre diameter by 4.4\\xa0% (control 14.6\\xa0μm vs. melatonin 14.0\\xa0μm; P\\u2009<\\u20090.03). In melatonin-treated goats, the average initiation date was earlier than in control goats (May 18, 2013 vs. July 2, 2013; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) but there was a similar cessation date (March 22, 2014 vs. March 27, 2014). Consequently, the duration of cashmere growth was longer in melatonin-treated goats than in control goats (307 vs.270\\xa0days; P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The final BW, average daily gain, kidding date, litter size, and birth weight were not influenced by melatonin implantation.ConclusionsThese data indicate that melatonin implantation (2\\xa0mg/kg BW) on two occasions (late April and June) increased cashmere yield by combining the induced growth of cashmere fleece with the typical growth and decreased the fibre diameter without changing dam growth rate or reproductive performance.',\n",
       " 'IMP (inosine 5′-monophosphate) is a compound that enhances the flavor of poultry meat. IMP has become a new breeding trait to improve poultry meat quality. We tried to identify several potential regulatory genes, and construct their predicted regulatory relationships. Time series gene expression profiles of thigh muscle tissues of Rugao chicken, a famous indigenous breed in China, were performed for analysis of genes that are co-expressed or correlated with the concentration of IMP. We found 15 crucial co-expression genes, which are Hspa2, Pten, Gabpa, Bpi, Mkl1, Srf, Cd34, Hspa4, Etv6, Bmpr2, Gde1, Igfbp5, Cd28, Pecam1 and Gja1, that may directly or indirectly regulate IMP metabolism. Eventually, we computed the correlation coefficient between 19 IMP Genes and 15 CGs (15 co-expression genes), and we identified and constructed a predicted regulation network. In conclusion, variation of IMP concentration was primarily connected with the muscle development process. During this process, 15 CGs were identified that may have significant influence on IMP metabolism. In particular, Bmpr2, Pten and co-expression genes correlated with Entpd8 might play important roles in regulating IMP de novo synthesis, decomposition and salvage synthesis.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAs a member of the Paramyxoviridae group, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is the key causative agent of Newcastle disease (ND) that attacks chickens, turkeys and other avian birds. Surviving birds showed lower feed utilization, growth performance or egg production, which results in severe economic losses. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different doses of NDV immunization on growth performance, plasma variables and immune response of broiler chickens.MethodsA total of 480 one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly administrated with 0, 4, 6 or 8 doses of NDV at 12 d and 28 d, respectively. Each group consisted of ten replicates with 12 birds each. Growth performance and organ weight were recorded. Plasma concentration of glucose, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acid was determined using commercial kits. The concentration of plasma corticosterone and insulin was measured using commercially available radio immune assay kits. Serum antibody titer and peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation were also recorded.ResultsThe results showed that NDV decreased body weight gain (BWG), and increased Feed:Gain ratio at 1–21 d at all doses (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Plasma insulin concentration was lower in all immunization groups after the first immunization at 12\\xa0d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The rest of the plasma indexes were not affected by NDV immunization, including glucose, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acid, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, as well as the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocyte (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Compared with the control group, NDV treatment elevated NDV antibody titer at 10\\xa0d after the first inoculation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and at d 5, 9 and 13 after the second inoculation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Repeated NDV inoculation had no deleterious impacts on body composition at 42\\xa0d, and nutrient accretion rates at 8–42 d (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05).ConclusionsIn conclusion, NDV challenge decreased BWG and feed efficiency in earlier stage of growth. However, NDV treatment at 6 doses down-regulated the Feed:Gain ratio by 6.36\\xa0% throughout the whole growing period. These data suggest that appropriate lower doses of NDV inoculation increase feed efficiency of broiler chickens.',\n",
       " 'With the widespread ban on the use of antibiotics in swine feed, alternative measures need to be sought to maintain swine health and performance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are part of the nonspecific defense system and are natural antibiotics produced by plants, insects, mammalians, and micro-organisms as well as by chemical synthesis. Due to their broad microbicidal activity against various fungi, bacteria and enveloped viruses, AMPs are a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics for use in swine production. This review focuses on the structure and mechanism of action of AMPs, as well as their effects on performance, immune function and intestinal health in pigs. The aim is to provide support for the application of AMPs as feed additives replacing antibiotics in swine nutrition.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundEarly pregnancy failure has a profound impact on both human reproductive health and animal production. 2/3 pregnancy failures occur during the peri-implantation period; however, the underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. Well-organized modification of the endometrium to a receptive state is critical to establish pregnancy. Aberrant endometrial modification during implantation is thought to be largely responsible for early pregnancy loss.ResultIn this study, using well-managed recipient ewes that received embryo transfer as model, we compared the endometrial proteome between pregnant and non-pregnant ewes during implantation period. After embryo transfer, recipients were assigned as pregnant or non-pregnant ewes according to the presence or absence of an elongated conceptus at Day 17 of pregnancy. By comparing the endometrial proteomic profiles between pregnant and non-pregnant ewes, we identified 94 and 257 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the endometrial caruncular and intercaruncular areas, respectively. Functional analysis showed that the DEPs were mainly associated with immune response, nutrient transport and utilization, as well as proteasome-mediated proteolysis.ConclusionThese analysis imply that dysfunction of these biological processes or pathways of DEP in the endometrium is highly associated with early pregnancy loss. In addition, many proteins that are essential for the establishment of pregnancy showed dysregulation in the endometrium of non-pregnant ewes. These proteins, as potential candidates, may contribute to early pregnancy loss.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundA novel extruded product was characterized with a metabolism and lactation trial to establish the product’s energy content, and its effects on lactating sow performance. The product was composed of a 60:40 corn-soybean blend, which was then extruded. This product containing the co-extruded 60:40 corn-soybean blend was commercially developed and is used extensively in swine diets in southwest Minnesota. GE of dietary treatments were determined by isoperibol bomb calorimetry. Twelve barrows (59.9 ± 1.4 kg), were used to determine the digestible and metabolizable energy of the extruded product. DE of treatments was determined by subtracting fecal energy from GE provided to barrows by each respective treatment. ME was determined by subtracting urinary energy from calculated digestible energy. Sixty-three sows were used for the lactation trial. Three dietary treatments were utilized: CONTROL (an industry standard diet); PRODUCT (contained the product, vitamins and minerals); OIL (matched the lysine:ME ratio of PRODUCT by addition of soy oil). Sow weight, backfat thickness at the right and left last ribs, body condition score, number of piglets, and litter weights were recorded on the date of farrowing (d 0), (d 9), and at weaning. Blood and milk samples were obtained at weaning, and blood was analyzed for plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), milk was analyzed for total protein and fat content.ResultsOn a dry-matter basis, the test diet provided 3,908 kcal/kg DE and 3,833 kcal/kg ME, which was significantly greater than the basal diet, which provided 3,633 kcal/kg DE and 3,567 kcal/kg ME (P < 0.0001). These data were used to establish the DE and ME of the product, which were 3,882 kcal/kg and 3,798 kcal/kg, respectively, on an as-fed basis. No effect of diet was observed for changes in sow backfat (RBF P = 0.24; LBF P = 0.07) or body condition score (P = 0.12) during lactation. Milk total protein (P = 0.69), fat (P = 0.66), PUN, average piglet gain (P = 0.55) and piglet mortality (P = 0.70) did not differ between treatments.ConclusionsWhile the novel extruded product was higher in energy content than traditional feedstuffs, it resulted in the same lactational sow performance. Thus, the co-extruded corn-soybean product is a reasonable inclusion in sow lactation diets.',\n",
       " 'Inadequate delivery of nutrients results in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in livestock. In ruminants, inadequate nutrition during pregnancy is often prevalent due to frequent utilization of exensive forage based grazing systems, making them highly susceptible to changes in nutrient quality and availability. Delivery of nutrients to the fetus is dependent on a number of critical factors including placental growth and development, utero-placental blood flow, nutrient availability, and placental metabolism and transport capacity. Previous findings from our laboratory and others, highlight essential roles for amino acids and their metabolites in supporting normal fetal growth and development, as well as the critical role for amino acid transporters in nutrient delivery to the fetus. The focus of this review will be on the role of maternal nutrition on placental form and function as a regulator of fetal development in ruminants.',\n",
       " 'Knowledge about the amino acid requirements and the response of pigs to the amino acid supply is essential in feed formulation. A deficient AA supply results in a reduction in performance while an oversupply is costly and leads to excessive nitrogen excretion with a potentially negative environmental impact. Amino acid requirements are determined to a large extent by the protein deposition in the body and, for lactating sows, by the protein exported in the milk. The concept of ideal protein was developed more than 50\\xa0years ago and refers to a protein with an amino acid profile that exactly meets the animal’s requirement so that all amino acids are equally limiting for performance. Because Lys typically is the first-limiting amino acid, the ideal amino acid profile is often expressed relative to Lys. Although the ideal protein profile is often assumed to be constant for a given production stage, (small) changes in the ideal protein profile can occur within a production stage. This can be caused by changes in the relative contribution of the different components of amino acid requirements during the productive life on the animal (e.g. changes in the relative contribution of growth and maintenance). Amino acids requirements can be determined experimentally using dose–response studies. The design of the study, the chosen response criterion, and the statistical model affect the requirement estimate. Although considerable experimental work has been carried out to determine the requirements for Lys, Met, Thr, and Trp in growing pigs (and to a lesser extent in sows), little is known about the requirements for the other essential amino acids. Experimental dose–response studies generally focus on the requirement and less on the overall response (i.e. what are the consequences of an amino acid deficiency?). This latter aspect is, to some extent, accounted for in modelling approaches that quantify the response of the animal to the amino acid supply in a dynamic way. The paper describes the origin of ideal protein and illustrates how fundamental concepts of amino acid nutrition have been integrated in practical modeling approaches for the nutrition of growing pigs and sows.',\n",
       " 'Probiotics are living microorganisms that provide a wide variety of health benefits to the host when ingested in adequate amounts. The bacterial strains most frequently used as probiotic agents are lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus reuteri, which is one of the few endogenous Lactobacillus species found in the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates, including humans, rats, pigs and chickens. L. reuteri is one of the most well documented probiotic species and has been widely utilized as a probiotic in humans and animals for many years. Initially, L. reuteri was used in humans to reduce the incidence and the severity of diarrhea, prevent colic and necrotic enterocolitis, and maintain a functional mucosal barrier. As interest in alternatives to in-feed antibiotics has grown in recent years, some evidence has emerged that probiotics may promote growth, improve the efficiency of feed utilization, prevent diarrhea, and regulate the immune system in pigs. In this review, the characteristics of L. reuteri are described, in order to update the evidence on the efficacy of using L. reuteri in pigs.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundRapeseed cake is a good source of protein for animal feed but its utilization is limited due to the presence of anti-nutritional substances, such as glucosinolates (Gls), phytic acid, tannins etc. In the present study, a solid state fermentation (SSF) using Aspergillus niger was carried out with the purpose of degrading glucosinolates and improving the nutritional quality of rapeseed cake (RSC). The effects of medium composition and incubation conditions on the Gls content in fermented rapeseed cake (FRSC) were investigated, and chemical composition and amino acid in vitro digestibility of RSC substrate fermented under optimal conditions were determined.ResultsAfter 72\\xa0h of incubation at 34°C, a 76.89% decrease in Gls of RSC was obtained in solid medium containing 70% RSC, 30% wheat bran at optimal moisture content 60% (w/w). Compared to unfermented RSC, trichloroacetic acid soluble protein (TCA-SP), crude protein and ether extract contents of the FRSC were increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) 103.71, 23.02 and 23.54%, respectively. As expected, the contents of NDF and phytic acid declined (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by 9.12 and 44.60%, respectively. Total amino acids (TAA) and essential amino acids (EAA) contents as well as AA in vitro digestibility of FRSC were improved significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Moreover, the enzyme activity of endoglucanase, xylanase, acid protease and phytase were increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) during SSF.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the solid state fermentation offers an effective approach to improving the quality of proteins sources such as rapeseed cake.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPrevious studies with broiler have shown dietary supplementation with multi-enzyme complex containing non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) degrading enzymes and phytase is efficient in releasing phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), energy and amino acids from corn-soybean meal diets or corn-sorghum diets, hence compensating considerable levels of nutrients in formulation. Notwithstanding, such potentials have not been well defined in duck nutrition. Giving China being the largest duck producing country, we conducted this study to establish adequate specifications of major nutrients along with multi-enzyme complex to meat duck from day-old to slaughter, focusing on performance, utilization of nutrients and bone mineralization. Five dietary treatments were: Positive control (PC,T1 ): the nutrients concentration of diet for 1 to 14 d of age were apparent metabolizable energy(AME) 2,800 kcal/kg, crude protein (CP)19.39%, Ca 0.85%, available phosphorus (avP) 0.42%; for 15 to 35 d of age these parameters were AME 2,900 kcal/kg, CP 16.47%,Ca 0.76%,avP 0.38%; Negative control 1(NC1,T2), the AME and digestible amino acids (DAA) were reduced by 70 kcal/kg and 2.0%, avP and Ca by 1.0 g/kg from PC diet; Negative control 2( NC2,T4), the down-spec from PC diet was AME 100 kcal/kg, DAA 2.5%, avP 1.5 g/kg and Ca 1.2 g/kg; The enzyme complex was added at the same dosage (200 mL/ 1,000 kg) on NC1 (T3) and NC2 (T5) diets.ResultsComparing with the ducks fed on T1, T3 and T5 diets, the birds fed on NC2 diet showed the lowest (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) body weight ( d 14 and 35), feed intake (d 35), tibia ash, Ca and P contents (d 14 and 35), and the utilization of nutrients (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The supplementation with the enzyme complex to the NC diets restored growth rate, utilization of nutrients and bone mineralization to the level of the PC diet, and increased AME by 60 kcal/kg and 117 kcal/kg, respectively for the NC1 and NC2 diets.ConclusionThese results suggest that down-spec AME by 100 kcal/kg, DAA by 2.5%, avP by 1.5 g/kg and Ca by 1.2 g/kg caused detrimental effects on duck performance compared with those fed on the PC diet, and these performance losses can be compensated by the addition of the multiple-enzyme complex.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundTo induce peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) expression and increase milk fat utilization in pigs at birth, the effect of maternal feeding of the PPARα agonist, clofibrate (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methyl-propanoic acid, ethyl ester), on fatty acid oxidation was examined at full-term delivery (0 h) and 24 h after delivery in this study. Each group of pigs (n = 10) was delivered from pregnant sows fed a commercial diet with or without 0.8% clofibrate for the last 7 d of gestation. Blood samples were collected from the utero-ovarian artery of the sows and the umbilical cords of the pigs as they were removed from the sows by C-section on day 113 of gestation.ResultsHPLC analysis identified that clofibric acid was present in the plasma of the clofibrate-fed sow (~4.2 μg/mL) and its offspring (~1.5 μg/mL). Furthermore, the maternal-fed clofibrate had no impact on the liver weight of the pigs at 0 h and 24 h, but hepatic fatty acid oxidation examined in fresh homogenates showed that clofibrate increased (P < 0.01) 14C-accumulation in CO2 and acid soluble products 2.9-fold from [1-14C]-oleic acid and 1.6-fold from [1-14C]-lignoceric acid respectively. Correspondingly, clofibrate increased fetal hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) activities by 36% and 42% over controls (P < 0.036). The mRNA abundance of CPT I was 20-fold higher in pigs exposed to clofibrate (P < 0.0001) but no differences were detected for ACO and PPARα mRNA between the two groups.ConclusionThese data demonstrate that dietary clofibrate is absorbed by the sow, crosses the placental membrane, and enters fetal circulation to induce hepatic fatty acid oxidation by increasing the CPT and ACO activities of the newborn.',\n",
       " 'Feed fats and oils provide significant amounts of energy to swine diets, but there is large variation in composition, quality, feeding value, and price among sources. Common measures of lipid quality include moisture, insolubles, and unsaponifiables (MIU), titer, and free fatty acid content, but provide limited information regarding their feeding value. Lipid peroxidation is an important quality factor related to animal growth performance and health, but maximum tolerable limits in various lipids have not been established. Several indicative assays can be used to detect the presence of various peroxidation compounds, but due to the complexity and numerous compounds produced and degraded during peroxidation process, no single method can adequately determine the extent of peroxidation. Until further information is available, using a combination of peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and anisidine value appear to provide a reasonable assessment of the extent of peroxidation in a lipid at a reasonable cost. However, fatty acid composition of the lipid being evaluated should be considered when selecting specific assays. Predictive tests can also be used to estimate the stability or susceptibility of lipids to peroxidation and include active oxygen method, oil stability index, and oxygen bomb method. A review of 16 published studies with pigs has shown an average decrease of 11.4% in growth rate, 8.8% feed intake fed isocaloric diets containing peroxidized lipids compared to diets containing unperoxidized lipids of the same source. Furthermore, serum vitamin E content was generally reduced and serum TBARS content was increased when peroxidized lipids were fed in these studies, suggesting that feeding peroxidized lipids negatively affects metabolic oxidative status of pigs. However, it is unclear if antioxidants are useful additions to lipids to maintain optimal nutritional value, or if their addition to swine diets is beneficial in overcoming a metabolic oxidative challenge.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundMetabolic profile was initially designed as a presymptomatic diagnostic aid based on statistical analyses of blood metabolites to provide an early warning of certain types of metabolic disorder. However, there is little metabolic profile data available about Korean Hanwoo cows. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the reference intervals of metabolic profile for Korean Hanwoo cows.MethodsHealthy animals (2,205) were selected and divided into early (day 1 to 95), middle (day 96 to 190) and late (day 191 to 285) period according to their gestating period. Metabolic profile including total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), urea (UREA), glucose (Glu), total cholesterol (T-Cho), long-chain fatty acid (LCFA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatinine (Crea), calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphorous (iP) and magnesium (Mg) were analyzed using a TBA-40FR automatic biochemical analyzer. The data of Korean Hanwoo cows were then compared to those of the Japanese Wagyu cows.ResultsMost of the data of the Korean Hanwoo cows were relatively higher than those of Japanese Wagyu cows, with the exception of Glu and GGT. This may indicate that the nutritional level of feed for the Korean Hanwoo cows was higher than that of the Japanese Wagyu cows because of the different feeding system. In particular, relatively higher levels of UREA and LCFA were observed in the Korean Hanwoo cows, and this may also contribute to the low reproduction efficiency.ConclusionsThese findings may provide some theoretical basis for understanding the reproductive and feeding situation of Korean Hanwoo cows.',\n",
       " 'This paper summarizes the current knowledge regarding the possible modes of action and nutritional factors involved in the use of essential oils (EOs) for swine and poultry. EOs have recently attracted increased interest as feed additives to be fed to swine and poultry, possibly replacing the use of antibiotic growth promoters which have been prohibited in the European Union since 2006. In general, EOs enhance the production of digestive secretions and nutrient absorption, reduce pathogenic stress in the gut, exert antioxidant properties and reinforce the animal’s immune status, which help to explain the enhanced performance observed in swine and poultry. However, the mechanisms involved in causing this growth promotion are far from being elucidated, since data on the complex gut ecosystem, gut function, in vivo oxidative status and immune system are still lacking. In addition, limited information is available regarding the interaction between EOs and feed ingredients or other feed additives (especially pro- or prebiotics and organic acids). This knowledge may help feed formulators to better utilize EOs when they formulate diets for poultry and swine.',\n",

To address this issue, we systematically analyzed chicken hypothalamus transcriptome responses to thermal stress using a 44 k chicken Agilent microarray,MethodsHypothalamus samples were collected from a control group reared at 25°C, a heat-stress group treated at 34°C for 24 h, and a temperature-recovery group reared at 25°C for 24 h following a heat-stress treatment. We compared the expression profiles between each pair of the three groups using microarray data.ResultsA total of 1,967 probe sets were found to be differentially expressed in the three comparisons with P < 0.05 and a fold change (FC) higher than 1.5, and the genes were mainly involved in self-regulation and compensation required to maintain homeostasis. Consistent expression results were found for 11 selected genes by quantitative real-time PCR. Thirty-eight interesting differential expression genes were found from GO term annotation and those genes were related to meat quality, growth, and crucial enzymes. Using these genes for genetic network analysis, we obtained three genetic networks. Moreover, the transcripts of heat-shock protein, including Hsp 40 and Hsp 90, were significantly altered in response to thermal stress.ConclusionsThis study provides a broader understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying stress response in chickens and discovery of novel genes that are regulated in a specific thermal-stress manner.',\n",

In order to appreciate their in vivo mode of action, the supplementation effect of two of its xylanases, XynD and XynB from families GH10 and GH11 respectively, have been evaluated on two different wheat cultivars Caphorn and Isengrain, which were chosen amongst 6 varieties for their difference in non starch polysaccharides content and arabinoxylan composition.ResultsPolysaccharides digestion was followed during 6\\xa0h along the digestive tract using the TNO gastrointestinal model-1, to mimic monogastric metabolism. Polysaccharide degradation appeared to occur mainly at the jejunal level and was higher with Isengrain than with Caphorn. For both cultivars, XynD and XynB supplementation increased notably the amount of reducing end sugars into the jejuno-ileal dialysates, which has been confirmed by a valuable increase of the soluble glucose into the jejunal dialysates.ConclusionsThe amounts of arabinose and xylose into the dialysates and ileal deliveries increased consequently mainly for Caphorn, suggesting that XynD and XynB supplementation in wheat-based diet could alleviate the anti-nutritional effects of arabinoxylans by limiting the physical entrapment of starch and could increase the available metabolizable energy.',\n",
       " 'Developmental programming of the fetus has consequences for physiologic responses in the offspring as an adult and, more recently, is implicated in the expression of altered phenotypes of future generations. Some phenotypes, such as fertility, bone strength, and adiposity are highly relevant to food animal production and in utero factors that impinge on those traits are vital to understand. A key systemic regulatory hormone is growth hormone (GH), which has a developmental role in virtually all tissues and organs. This review catalogs the impact of GH on tissue programming and how perturbations early in development influence GH function.',\n",

       " 'Many advances in genetic selection, nutrition, housing and disease control have been incorporated into modern pork production since the 1950s resulting in highly prolific females and practices and technologies, which significantly increased efficiency of reproduction in the breeding herd. The objective of this manuscript is to review the literature and current industry practices employed for reproductive management. In particular the authors focus on assisted reproduction technologies and their application for enhanced productivity. Modern maternal line genotypes have lower appetites and exceptional lean growth potential compared to females of 20\\xa0yr ago. Thus, nutrient requirements and management techniques and technologies, which affect gilt development and sow longevity, require continuous updating. Failure to detect estrus accurately has the greatest impact on farrowing rate and litter size. Yet, even accurate estrus detection will not compensate for the variability in the interval between onset of estrus and actual time of ovulation. However, administration of GnRH analogs in weaned sows and in gilts after withdrawal of altrenogest do overcome this variability and thereby synchronize ovulation, which makes fixed-time AI practical. Seasonal infertility, mediated by temperature and photoperiod, is a persistent problem. Training workers in the art of stockmanship is of increasing importance as consumers become more interested in humane animal care. Altrenogest, is used to synchronize the estrous cycle of gilts, to prolong gestation for 2–3 d to synchronize farrowing and to postpone post-weaning estrus. P.G. 600® is used for induction of estrus in pre-pubertal gilts and as a treatment to overcome seasonal anestrous. Sperm cell numbers/dose of semen is significantly less for post cervical AI than for cervical AI. Real-time ultrasonography is used to determine pregnancy during wk 3–5. PGF2α effectively induces farrowing when administered within two d of normal gestation length. Ovulation synchronization, single fixed-time AI and induced parturition may lead to farrowing synchronization, which facilitates supervision and reduces stillbirths and piglet mortality. Attendance and assistance at farrowing is important especially to ensure adequate colostrum consumption by piglets immediately after birth. New performance terminologies are presented.',\n",
       " 'Fermented liquid feed is feed that has been mixed with water at a ratio ranging from 1:1.5 to 1:4. By mixing with water, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts naturally occurring in the feed proliferate and produce lactic acid, acetic acid and ethanol which reduces the pH of the mixture. This reduction in pH inhibits pathogenic organisms from developing in the feed. In addition, when this low pH mixture is fed, it reduces the pH in the stomach of pigs and prevents the proliferation of pathogens such as coliforms and Salmonella in the gastrointestinal tract. For piglets, the use of fermented liquid feed offers the possibility of simultaneously providing feed and water, which may facilitate an easier transition from sow’s milk to solid feed. Secondly, offering properly produced fermented liquid feed may strengthen the role of the stomach as the first line of defense against possible pathogenic infections by lowering the pH in the gastrointestinal tract thereby helping to exclude enteropathogens. Finally, feeding fermented liquid feed to pigs has been shown to improve the performance of suckling pigs, weaner pigs and growing-finishing pigs. In this review, current knowledge about the use of fermented liquid feed in pig diets will be discussed. This will include a discussion of the desirable properties of fermented liquid feed and factors affecting fermentation. In addition, advantages and disadvantages of fermented liquid feed will be discussed including its effects on gastrointestinal health, intestinal pH and the types of bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract as well as the effects of fermented liquid feeds on pig performance.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThere is considerable interest in using goats as models for genetically engineering dairy animals and also for using stem cells as therapeutics for bone and cartilage repair. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated and characterized from various species, but are poorly characterized in goats.ResultsGoat MSCs isolated from bone marrow (BM-MSCs) and adipose tissue (ASCs) have the ability to undergo osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. Cytochemical staining and gene expression analysis show that ASCs have a greater capacity for adipogenic differentiation compared to BM-MSCs and fibroblasts. Different methods of inducing adipogenesis also affect the extent and profile of adipogenic differentiation in MSCs. Goat fibroblasts were not capable of osteogenesis, hence distinguishing them from the MSCs. Goat MSCs and fibroblasts express CD90, CD105, CD73 but not CD45, and exhibit cytoplasmic localization of OCT4 protein. Goat MSCs can be stably transfected by Nucleofection, but, as evidenced by colony-forming efficiency (CFE), yield significantly different levels of progenitor cells that are robust enough to proliferate into colonies of integrants following G418 selection. BM-MSCs expanded over increasing passages in vitro maintained karyotypic stability up to 20 passages in culture, exhibited an increase in adipogenic differentiation and CFE, but showed altered morphology and amenability to genetic modification by selection.ConclusionsOur findings provide characterization information on goat MSCs, and show that there can be significant differences between MSCs isolated from different tissues and from within the same tissue. Fibroblasts do not exhibit trilineage differentiation potential at the same capacity as MSCs, making it a more reliable method for distinguishing MSCs from fibroblasts, compared to cell surface marker expression.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundLimited availability of fish meal and whey protein concentrate increases overall feed costs. Availability of increased number of supplemental amino acids including Lys, Met, Thr, Trp, Val, and Ile allows replacing expensive protein supplements to reduce feed costs. This study was to evaluate the effect of replacing fish meal and/or whey protein concentrate in nursery diets with 6 supplemental amino acids on growth performance and gut health of post-weaning pigs. Treatments were 1) FM-WPC: diet with fish meal (FM) and whey protein concentrate (WPC); 2) FM-AA: diet with FM and crystalline amino acids (L-Lys, L-Thr, L-Trp, DL-Met, L-Val, and L-Ile); 3) WPC-AA: diet with WPC and crystalline amino acid; and 4) AA: diet with crystalline amino acid.ResultsPigs in FM-AA, WPC-AA, and AA had greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) ADG and gain:feed than pigs in FM-WPC during wk 1 (phase 1). Plasma insulin concentration of pigs in AA tended to be greater (P\\u2009=\\u20090.064) than that of FM-WPC at the end of wk 1(phase 1). Plasma concentrations of IgG in AA was lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared with WPC-AA and FW, and FM-AA had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) IgG concentration than WPC-AA at the end of wk 1 (phase 1). Concentration of acetate in cecum digesta in FM-AA tended to be greater (P\\u2009=\\u20090.054) than that of FM-WPC and WPC-AA. Concentration of isovalerate in cecum digesta of pigs in FM-AA was greater (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than that of FW and WPC-AA.ConclusionsThis study indicates that use of 6 supplemental amino acids can replace fish meal and/or whey protein concentrate without adverse effects on growth performance, immune status, and gut health of pigs at d 21 to 49 of age. Positive response with the use of 6 supplemental amino acids in growth during the first week of post-weaning may due to increased plasma insulin potentially improving uptake of nutrients for protein synthesis and energy utilization. The replacement of fish meal and/or whey protein concentrate with 6 supplemental amino acids could decrease the crude protein level in nursery diets, and potentially lead to substantial cost savings in expensive nursery diets.',\n",
       " 'Osteopontin (OPN; also known as Secreted Phosphoprotein 1, SPP1) is a secreted extra-cellular matrix (ECM) protein that binds to a variety of cell surface integrins to stimulate cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion and communication. It is generally accepted that OPN interacts with apically expressed integrin receptors on the uterine luminal epithelium (LE) and conceptus trophectoderm to attach the conceptus to the uterus for implantation. Research conducted with pigs and sheep has significantly advanced understanding of the role(s) of OPN during implantation through exploitation of the prolonged peri-implantation period of pregnancy when elongating conceptuses are free within the uterine lumen requiring extensive paracrine signaling between conceptus and endometrium. This is followed by a protracted and incremental attachment cascade of trophectoderm to uterine LE during implantation, and development of a true epitheliochorial or synepitheliochorial placenta exhibited by pigs and sheep, respectively. In pigs, implanting conceptuses secrete estrogens which induce the synthesis and secretion of OPN in adjacent uterine LE. OPN then binds to αvβ6 integrin receptors on trophectoderm, and the αvβ3 integrin receptors on uterine LE to bridge conceptus attachment to uterine LE for implantation. In sheep, implanting conceptuses secrete interferon tau that prolongs the lifespan of CL. Progesterone released by CL then induces OPN synthesis and secretion from the endometrial GE into the uterine lumen where OPN binds integrins expressed on trophectoderm (αvβ3) and uterine LE (identity of specific integrins unknown) to adhere the conceptus to the uterus for implantation. OPN binding to the αvβ3 integrin receptor on ovine trophectoderm cells induces in vitro focal adhesion assembly, a prerequisite for adhesion and migration of trophectoderm, through activation of: 1) P70S6K via crosstalk between FRAP1/MTOR and MAPK pathways; 2) MTOR, PI3K, MAPK3/MAPK1 (Erk1/2) and MAPK14 (p38) signaling to stimulate trohectoderm cell migration; and 3) focal adhesion assembly and myosin II motor activity to induce migration of trophectoderm cells. Further large in vivo focal adhesions assemble at the uterine-placental interface of both pigs and sheep and identify the involvement of sizable mechanical forces at this interface during discrete periods of trophoblast migration, attachment and placentation in both species.',\n",
       " 'Litter size and birth weights are limited by uterine capacity, defined as the ability of the uterus to maintain the appropriate development of some number of conceptuses. Uterine capacity is the result of the combined effects of uterine, placental and embryo/fetal function. The number of living conceptuses that the uterus is capable of supporting is greater during early gestation compared to later gestation. Plots of log fetal weight versus log placental weight also indicate that fetal weights are less sensitive to reduced placental weight (and therefore reduced intrauterine space) in early gestation compared to late gestation. However, even in late gestation, mechanisms still exist that maintain fetal growth when the size of the placenta is reduced. One such mechanism is likely to be improved development of the folded placental-epithelial/maternal-epithelial bilayer. Fold depth, and therefore the maternal fetal interactive surface, increases as gestation advances and is greater in placenta from small fetuses. On the fetal side of the placenta, the epithelial bilayer is embedded in stromal tissue. Glycosaminoglycans are major components of stroma, including hyaluronan and heparan sulfate. Hyaluronidases and heparanases are present within placental tissues, and likely play roles in modification of stromal components to facilitate fold development. Glycosaminoglycans are polymers of forms of glucose (glucosamine, glucuronic acid, iduronic acid) suggesting that glycosaminoglycan synthesis may compete with the glucose needs of the developing fetus. Pig conceptuses are fructogenic, such that a substantial portion of glucose transferred from mother to fetus is converted to fructose. Fructose is an intermediate product in the synthesis of glucosamine from glucose, and glucosamine is linked to regulation of trophoblast cell proliferation through regulation of mTOR. These findings suggest a link between glucose, fructose, glucosamine synthesis, GAG production, and placental morphogenesis, but the details of these interactions remain unclear. In addition, recent placental epithelial transcriptome analysis identified several glucose, amino acid, lipid, vitamin, mineral and hormone transporter mechanisms within the placenta. Further elucidation of mechanisms of placental morphogenesis and solute transport could provide clues to improving nutrient transport to the pig fetus, potentially increasing litter size and piglet birth weights.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundHamburger is the most consumed beef product in North America, but lacks in nutritional appeal due to its high fat content and high proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA). Objectives of the present study were to improve the FA profiles of hamburgers made with perirenal fat (PRF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) when feeding steers different diets along with examining differences in sensory attributes and oxidative stability. Diets included a control diet containing 70:30 red clover silage: barley based concentrate, a diet containing sunflower-seed (SS) substituted for barley, and diets containing SS with 15% wheat dried distillers’ grain with solubles (DDGS-15) or 30% DDGS (DDGS-30). Hamburgers were made from triceps brachii and either PRF or SCF (80:20 w/w).ResultsPerirenal fat versus SCF hamburgers FA had 14.3% more (P <0.05) 18:0, 11.8% less cis (c) 9-18:1 (P <0.05), and 1.82% more total trans (t)-18:1 mainly in the form of t 11-18:1. During sensory evaluation, PRF versus SCF hamburgers had greater (P <0.05) mouth coating, but the difference was less than one panel unit. Examining effects of steer diet within PRF hamburgers, feeding the SS compared to the control diet increased (P <0.05) t-18:1 by 2.89% mainly in the form of t 11-18:1, feeding DGGS-15 diet led to no further changes (P >0.05), but feeding DDGS-30 diet reduced the proportions of (P <0.05) of t-18:1 chiefly t 11-18:1. Feeding SS and DDGS diets had small but significant (P <0.05) effects on hamburger sensory attributes and oxidative stability.ConclusionsFeeding high-forage diets including SS and 15% DDGS, and taking advantage of the FA heterogeneity between fat depots offers an opportunity to differentially enhance beef hamburgers with 18:2n-6 biohydrogenation products (i.e., t 11-18:1) with potential human health benefits without compromising their sensory attributes and oxidative stability during retail display.',\n",
       " 'The majority of pregnancy loss in ruminants occurs during the first three weeks after conception, particularly during the period of conceptus elongation that occurs prior to pregnancy recognition and implantation. This review integrates established and new information on the biological role of ovarian progesterone (P4), prostaglandins (PGs), interferon tau (IFNT) and cortisol in endometrial function and conceptus elongation. Progesterone is secreted by the ovarian corpus luteum (CL) and is the unequivocal hormone of pregnancy. Prostaglandins (PGs) and cortisol are produced by both the epithelial cells of the endometrium and the trophectoderm of the elongating conceptus. In contrast, IFNT is produced solely by the conceptus trophectoderm and is the maternal recognition of pregnancy signal that inhibits production of luteolytic pulses of PGF2α by the endometrium to maintain the CL and thus production of P4. Available results in sheep support the idea that the individual, interactive, and coordinated actions of P4, PGs, IFNT and cortisol regulate conceptus elongation and implantation by controlling expression of genes in the endometrium and/or trophectoderm. An increased knowledge of conceptus-endometrial interactions during early pregnancy in ruminants is necessary to understand and elucidate the causes of infertility and recurrent early pregnancy loss and provide new strategies to improve fertility and thus reproductive efficiency.',\n",

The review also considers the involvement of dysregulated TGFβ signaling in pathological conditions that cause pregnancy loss and fertility problems in women.',\n",
       " 'Establishment of pregnancy in pigs involves maintaining progesterone secretion from the corpora lutea in addition to regulating a sensitive interplay between the maternal immune system and attachment of the rapidly expanding trophoblast for nutrient absorption. The peri-implantation period of rapid trophoblastic elongation followed by attachment to the maternal uterine endometrium is critical for establishing a sufficient placental-uterine interface for subsequent nutrient transport for fetal survival to term, but is also marked by the required conceptus release of factors involved with stimulating uterine secretion of histotroph and modulation of the maternal immune system. Many endometrial genes activated by the conceptus secretory factors stimulate a tightly controlled proinflammatory response within the uterus. A number of the cytokines released by the elongating conceptuses stimulate inducible transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) potentially regulating the maternal uterine proinflammatory and immune response. This review will establish the current knowledge for the role of conceptus cytokine production and release in early development and establishment of pregnancy in the pig.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIdentification of functional genes affecting milk production traits is very crucial for improving breeding efficiency in dairy cattle. Many potential candidate genes have been identified through our previous genome wide association study (GWAS). Of these, GPIHBP1 is an important novel candidate gene for milk production traits. However, the mRNA structure of the bovine GPIHBP1 gene is not fully determined up to now.ResultsIn this study, we identified a novel alternatively splice transcript variant (X5) which leads to a 31\\xa0bp insertion in exon 3 and also confirmed the other four existed transcripts (X1, X2, X3 and X4) of the bovine GPIHBP1 gene. We showed that transcript X5 with a 31\\xa0bp insertion and transcript X1 with an 8\\xa0bp deletion might have tremendous effect on the protein function and structure of GPIHBP1, respectively. With semi-quantitative PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we found that the mRNA expression of GPIHBP1, GPIHBP1-X1 and GPIHBP1-X5 in mammary gland of lactating cows were much higher than that in other tissues.ConclusionsOur study reports a novel alternative splicing of GPIHBP1 in bovine for the first time and provide useful information for the further functional analyses of GPIHBP1 in dairy cattle.',\n",
       " 'Oxidative stress can induce abnormal tryptophan metabolism. The present study was mainly conducted to determine the effect of dietary tryptophan levels on oxidative stress in the liver of weaned pigs challenged by diquat. A total of 36 PIC piglets weaned at 21\\xa0days of age were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 diets containing dietary tryptophan levels of 0.18, 0.30, and 0.45% for 14 d. On day 8, the piglets were injected intraperitoneally with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution or diquat (10\\xa0mg/kg body weight). During the first 7 d of trial, increasing dietary tryptophan levels enhanced average daily gain (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) and average daily feed intake (P\\u2009=\\u20090.08), and decreased the feed efficiency (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) of piglets. The growth performance was decreased by diquat injection (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Diquat injection also decreased the activities of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the plasma and liver (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), increased plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and urea nitrogen (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) concentrations, and enhanced MDA concentration (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07) in liver of piglets. Increasing dietary tryptophan levels could attenuate the effects of diquat injection on the MDA (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) concentration and the activities of SOD (P\\u2009=\\u20090.09) and GPx (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) of the liver, and plasma urea nitrogen (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) concentration in the piglet. There was a synergistic role for increasing TDO activity in the liver between dietary tryptophan levels and diquat injection (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). These results suggest that increasing dietary tryptophan levels could attenuate the oxidative stress of the liver in weaned piglets intraperitoneally injected with diquat via enhancing the antioxidant capacity.',\n",
       " 'Epigenetics provides a molecular mechanism of inheritance that is not solely dependent on DNA sequence and that can account for non-Mendelian inheritance patterns. Epigenetic changes underlie many normal developmental processes, and can lead to disease development as well. While epigenetic effects have been studied in well-characterized rodent models, less research has been done using agriculturally important domestic animal species. This review will present the results of current epigenetic research using farm animal models (cattle, pigs, sheep and chickens). Much of the work has focused on the epigenetic effects that environmental exposures to toxicants, nutrients and infectious agents has on either the exposed animals themselves or on their direct offspring. Only one porcine study examined epigenetic transgenerational effects; namely the effect diet micronutrients fed to male pigs has on liver DNA methylation and muscle mass in grand-offspring (F2 generation). Healthy viable offspring are very important in the farm and husbandry industry and epigenetic differences can be associated with production traits. Therefore further epigenetic research into domestic animal health and how exposure to toxicants or nutritional changes affects future generations is imperative.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe objective of this study was to characterize the changes in various metabolic parameters in blood and milk during IMI challenge with Escherichia coli (E. coli) for dairy cows during early lactation. Thirty, healthy primiparous Holstein cows were infused (h = 0) with ~20-40 cfu of live E. coli into one front mammary quarter at ~4-6 wk in lactation. Daily feed intake and milk yield were recorded. At –12, 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180 and 192 h relative to challenge rectal temperatures were recorded and quarter foremilk was collected for analysis of shedding of E. coli. Composite milk samples were collected at -180, -132, -84, -36, -12, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 132 and 180 h relative to challenge (h = 0) and analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), somatic cell count, fat, protein, lactose, citrate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), free glucose (fglu), and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Blood was collected at -12, 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 60, 72, 84, 132 and 180 h relative to challenge and analyzed for plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), BHBA and glucose concentration. A generalized linear mixed model was used to determine the effect of IMI challenge on metabolic responses of cows during early lactation.ResultsBy 12\\xa0h, E. coli was recovered from challenged quarters and shedding continued through 72\\xa0h. Rectal temperature peaked by 12\\xa0h post-challenge and returned to pre-challenge values by 36\\xa0h post-IMI challenge. Daily feed intake and milk yield decreased (P <0.05) by 1 and 2 d, respectively, after mastitis challenge. Plasma BHBA decreased (12\\xa0h; P <0.05) from 0.96\\u2009±\\u20091.1 at 0\\xa0h to 0.57\\u2009±\\u20090.64\\xa0mmol/L by 18\\xa0h whereas concentration of plasma NEFA (18\\xa0h) and glucose (24\\xa0h) were significantly greater, 11 and 27%, respectively, after challenge. In milk, fglu, lactose, citrate, fat and protein yield were lower whereas yield of BHBA and G6P were higher after challenge when compared to pre-challenge values.ConclusionsChanges in metabolites in blood and milk were most likely associated with drops in feed intake and milk yield. However, the early rise in plasma NEFA may also signify enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis. Lower concentrations of plasma BHBA may be attributed to an increase transfer into milk after IMI. Decreases in both milk lactose yield and % after challenge may be partly attributed to reduced conversion of fglu to lactose. Rises in G6P yield and concentration in milk after challenge (24 h) may signify increased conversion of fglu to G6P. Results identify changes in various metabolic parameters in blood and milk after IMI challenge with E. coli in dairy cows that may partly explain the partitioning of nutrients and changes in milk components after IMI for cows during early lactation.',\n",

Our dRT-PCR assay can be completed in 1.5\\xa0h from when a sample is received to obtaining a result. Additionally, the sensitivity of dRT-PCR matched that of conventional reverse transcription PCR (cRT-PCR) that used purified RNA. The lowest detection limit of HP-PRRSV was 6.3 TCID50 using dRT-PCR. We applied dRT-PCR assay to 144 field samples and the results showed strong consistency with those obtained by cRT-PCR. Moreover, the dRT-PCR method was able to tolerate 5-20% (v/v) serum.ConclusionsOur dRT-PCR assay allows for easier, faster, more cost-effective and higher throughput detection of HP-PRRSV compared with cRT-PCR methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe a real-time RT-PCR assay capable of detecting PRRSV in crude serum samples without the requirement for purifying RNA. We believe our approach has a great potential for application to other RNA viruses.',\n",

Broiler performance was evaluated from d 25 to 42. Eight birds from each treatment were slaughtered on d 42 and plasma and breast muscle samples were collected to measure biochemical indices.ResultsA higher stocking density tended to be associated with reduced weight gain (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10), and significantly increased plasma glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Increased dietary TRP significantly reduced the activities of lactic dehydrogenase and GPT while increasing total cholesterol in the plasma (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), reducing drip loss of breast muscle (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) and improving feed efficiency (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10).ConclusionsAn increase in dietary TRP, 1.5-fold higher than the standard supplementation level, can alleviate oxidative stress as well as improve welfare and feed efficiency in broilers reared in cages with a high stocking density.',\n",

Compared with CON, muscle lipid content was increased in OVER (212.4%) and RES (92.5%) at d 1 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). Muscle lipid content was increased 36.1% in OVER and decreased 23.6% in RES compared with CON at 3 mo (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). At d 1, myostatin mRNA abundance in whole muscle tended to be greater in OVER (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07) than CON. Follistatin mRNA abundance increased in OVER (P\\u2009=\\u20090.04) and tended to increase in RES (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) compared with CON at d 1. However, there was no difference in myostatin or follistatin protein expression (P\\u2009>\\u20090.3). Phosphorylated Akt (ser473) was increased in RES at 3 mo compared with CON (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006).ConclusionsIn conclusion, maternal over and restricted nutrient intake alters muscle lipid content and growth of offspring, possibly through altered gene and protein expression.',\n",

Experimental animals were fed either a concentrate (CD) or a hay diet (HD) for 4 d and then deprived of feed for either 12-h or 24-h before slaughter. Blood samples were collected for plasma cortisol and blood metabolite analyses. Longisimus muscle (LM) pH was measured. Skin and carcass swabs were obtained to assess microbial loads. Plasma creatine kinase activity (863.9 and 571.7\\u2009±\\u200995.21\\xa0IU) and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations (1,056.1 and 589.8\\u2009±\\u2009105.01\\xa0mEq/L) were different (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) between sheep and goats. Species and diet treatments had significant effects on the ultimate pH of LM. Pre-holding total coliform (TCC) and aerobic plate counts (APC) of skin were significantly different between species. Goats had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) TCC (2.1 vs. 3.0 log10 CFU/cm2) and APC (8.2 vs. 8.5 log10 CFU/cm2) counts in the skin compared to sheep. Preslaughter skin E. coli counts and TCC were different (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) between species. Goats had lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) counts of E. coli (2.2 vs. 2.9 log10 CFU/cm2) and TCC (2.3 vs. 3.0 log10 CFU/cm2) in the skin compared with those in sheep. Diet, species, and FDT had no effect (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) on E. coli and TCC in carcass swab samples. The APC of carcass swab samples were only affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by the FDT.

       " 'BackgroundMethane (CH4) emissions in cattle are an undesirable end product of rumen methanogenic fermentative activity as they are associated not only with negative environmental impacts but also with reduced host feed efficiency. The aim of this study was to quantify total and specific rumen microbial methanogenic populations in beef cattle divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) while offered (i) a low energy high forage (HF) diet followed by (ii) a high energy low forage (LF) diet. Ruminal fluid was collected from 14 high (H) and 14 low (L) RFI animals across both dietary periods. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted to quantify the abundance of total and specific rumen methanogenic microbes. Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the association between the relative abundance of methanogens and animal performance, rumen fermentation variables and diet digestibility.ResultsAbundance of methanogens, did not differ between RFI phenotypes. However, relative abundance of total and specific methanogen species was affected (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by diet type, with greater abundance observed while animals were offered the LF compared to the HF diet.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that differences in abundance of specific rumen methanogen species may not contribute to variation in CH4 emissions between efficient and inefficient animals, however dietary manipulation can influence the abundance of total and specific methanogen species.',\n",

The study was performed using 16 barrows (weight, 45.3\\u2009±\\u20094.5\\xa0kg) that were fitted with a T cannula at the terminal ileum. There were four treatments: a corn-soybean diet without CGF and three corn-soybean diets containing increasing levels of CGF (65, 130, and 195\\xa0g/kg). Data were analyzed according to a randomized complete block design, four blocks with four pigs each (one pig per treatment). The trend of the response (linear or quadratic) was determined using orthogonal contrasts, and when a linear effect was determined, a linear equation was obtained.ResultsThe results showed that the inclusion up to 195\\xa0g/kg of CGF in the corn-soybean diet did not diminish the ileal digestibility (apparent and standardized) of protein and amino acids (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05), except that of phenylalanine, cystine, and proline. A linear decrease (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) per gram of CGF added to the diet in the apparent and standardized ileal digestibility of phenylalanine (0.011 and 0.015 percentage units, respectively), cystine (0.048 and 0.043 percentage units, respectively), and proline (0.045 and 0.047 percentage units, respectively) was noted.

Fifty-six gilts (Trial 1) and 56 sows (Trial 2) were assigned to one of 4 treatments according to their mating weight, respectively. The treatments comprised corn-soybean meal based gestation and lactation diets (0.21% magnesium) supplemented with 0, 0.015, 0.03, or 0.045%\\xa0Mg from mating until weaning. The results showed that magnesium supplementation significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) reduced the weaning to estrus interval in both gilts and sows. There were significant effects (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) of supplemental magnesium on the total number of piglets born, born alive and weaned in sows. In late gestation and lactation, the digestibility of crude fiber (quadratic effects, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and crude protein (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), were significantly influenced by magnesium in gilts and sows, respectively. There were differences among the 4 groups in terms of the apparent digestibility of dry matter and crude fiber in sows (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) during both early and late gestation. The apparent digestibility of gross energy was increased for sows in late gestation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and lactation (quadratic effects, P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). At farrowing and weaning, serum prolactin levels and alkaline phosphate activities linearly increased in sows as the Mg supplementation increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Serum Mg of sows at farrowing and serum urea nitrogen of sows at weaning was significantly influenced by Mg supplementation (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The Mg concentration in sow colostrum and the serum of their piglets were increased by supplemental magnesium (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, growth hormone levels were linearly elevated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the serum of piglets suckling sows.

       " 'BackgroundPrevious research indicates that bahiagrass may be successfully conserved as baleage, but nutritive value is typically low for lactating dairy cows. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of adding modest amounts of alfalfa forage (22%), achieved by inter-seeding alfalfa into an existing bahiagrass pasture, on baleage nutritive value and lactation performance of Holstein cows. Forage treatments employed were monoculture bahiagrass baleage (MBB; negative control), bahiagrass-alfalfa mixture baleage (BAB) and conventional corn silage (CCS; positive control). Thirty six mid lactation Holstein cows [34.8\\u2009±\\u20095.8\\xa0kg 3.5% fat-corrected milk and 112\\u2009±\\u200919 d in milk (DIM)] were stratified according to milk yield and DIM and assigned randomly to 1 of 3 forage treatments. Cows were trained to Calan feeding gates and were offered a common CCS-based TMR in a 10-d covariance period followed by a 42-d treatment feeding period.ResultsThe BAB contained more protein and less NDF than MBB (12.6 vs 10.3% CP and 71.8 vs 76.6% NDF). Diet DMI was similar for MBB and BAB (19.5 vs 21.6\\xa0kg/hd/d), but cows consumed more of the CCS diet (25.5\\xa0kg/hd/d) than either baleage-based diet. Cows offered BAB tended to produce more milk than cows offered MBB based TMR (28.4 vs 26.1\\xa0kg/hd/d), but both baleage diets generated less milk than CCS-based diets (33.1\\xa0kg/hd/d). Milk composition was similar across diets except for milk protein concentrations which were higher for CCS than either MBB or BAB diets; however, milk urea nitrogen (MUN) was lowest for cows fed CCS diets. Cow BW gain was higher for BAB than MBB implying that a portion of the higher energy contributed by the alfalfa was being used to replenish weight on these mid lactation cows.ConclusionsData from this study indicate that alfalfa inter-seeded in bahiagrass sod that produces BAB with as little as 22% alfalfa may improve nutritive value compared to monoculture bahiagrass baleage and marginally improve lactation performance of Holstein cows. However, the CCS diet was vastly superior to either MBB or BAB-based diets for milk production.',\n",

The detected percentages of ZEA were 100, 100, 54, 100 and 100 with mean levels of 109.1, 14.9, 9.2, 882.7 and 58.9\\xa0ppb in the same samples. In the wheat bran and soybean meal samples, the content of all four mycotoxins were below the maximum limits set by Chinese regulations while the percentage of samples that exceeded regulatory limits were 7, 57 and 7% for corn, and 7, 14 and 3% for the complete feeds for AFB1, DON and OTA respectively. DDGS showed the most serious mycotoxin contamination and the percentage of samples that exceeded regulatory limits were 6, 88 and 41%, for AFB1, DON and ZEA, respectively.ConclusionsThis paper is the first to present data on the natural occurrence of AFB1, DON, ZEA and OTA in ingredients and complete feeds obtained from swine farms in China’s Beijing region. The data shows that feed ingredients and complete swine feeds obtained from these farms are most often contaminated with DON followed by contamination with AFB1 and ZEA.',\n",
       " 'Identification and characterization of mammary stem cells and progenitor cells from dairy animals is important in the understanding of mammogenesis, tissue turnover, lactation persistency and regenerative therapy. It has been realized by many investigators that altered lactation, long dry periods (non-milking period between two consecutive lactation cycles), abrupt cessation of lactation (common in water buffaloes) and disease conditions like mastitis, greatly reduce milk yield thus render huge financial losses within the dairy sector. Cellular manipulation of specialized cell types within the mammary gland, called mammary stem cells (MaSCs)/progenitor cells, might provide potential solutions to these problems and may improve milk production. In addition, MaSCs/progenitor cells could be used in regenerative therapy against tissue damage caused by mastitis. This review discusses methods of MaSC/progenitor cell manipulation and their mechanisms in bovine and caprine animals. Author believes that intervention of MaSCs/progenitor cells could lessen the huge financial losses to the dairy industry globally.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe expression of genes encoding proteins involved in triacyglyceride and fatty acid synthesis and storage in cattle muscle are correlated with intramuscular fat (IMF)%. Are the same genes also correlated with IMF% in sheep muscle, and can the same set of genes be used to estimate IMF% in both species?ResultsThe correlation between gene expression (microarray) and IMF% in the longissimus muscle (LM) of twenty sheep was calculated. An integrated analysis of this dataset with an equivalent cattle correlation dataset and a cattle differential expression dataset was undertaken. A total of 30 genes were identified to be strongly correlated with IMF% in both cattle and sheep. The overlap of genes was highly significant, 8 of the 13 genes in the TAG gene set and 8 of the 13 genes in the FA gene set were in the top 100 and 500 genes respectively most correlated with IMF% in sheep, P-value = 0. Of the 30 genes, CIDEA, THRSP, ACSM1, DGAT2 and FABP4 had the highest average rank in both species. Using the data from two small groups of Brahman cattle (control and Hormone growth promotant-treated [known to decrease IMF% in muscle]) and 22 animals in total, the utility of a direct measure and different estimators of IMF% (ultrasound and gene expression) to differentiate between the two groups were examined. Directly measured IMF% and IMF% estimated from ultrasound scanning could not discriminate between the two groups. However, using gene expression to estimate IMF% discriminated between the two groups. Increasing the number of genes used to estimate IMF% from one to five significantly increased the discrimination power; but increasing the number of genes to 15 resulted in little further improvement.ConclusionWe have demonstrated the utility of a comparative approach to identify robust estimators of IMF% in the LM in cattle and sheep. We have also demonstrated a number of approaches (potentially applicable to much smaller groups of animals than conventional methods) to using gene expression to rank animals for IMF% within a single farm/treatment, or to estimate differences in IMF% between two farms/treatments.',\n",
       " 'Amino acids are building blocks for proteins in all animals. Based on growth or nitrogen balance, amino acids were traditionally classified as nutritionally essential or nonessential for mammals, birds and fish. It was assumed that all the “nutritionally nonessential amino acids (NEAA)” were synthesized sufficiently in the body to meet the needs for maximal growth and optimal health. However, careful analysis of the scientific literature reveals that over the past century there has not been compelling experimental evidence to support this assumption. NEAA (e.g., glutamine, glutamate, proline, glycine and arginine) play important roles in regulating gene expression, cell signaling, antioxidative responses, fertility, neurotransmission, and immunity. Additionally, glutamate, glutamine and aspartate are major metabolic fuels for the small intestine to maintain its digestive function and to protect the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. Thus, diets for animals must contain all NEAA to optimize their survival, growth, development, reproduction, and health. Furthermore, NEAA should be taken into consideration in revising the “ideal protein” concept that is currently used to formulate swine and poultry diets. Adequate provision of all amino acids (including NEAA) in diets enhances the efficiency of animal production. In this regard, amino acids should not be classified as nutritionally essential or nonessential in animal or human nutrition. The new Texas A&M University’s optimal ratios of dietary amino acids for swine and chickens are expected to beneficially reduce dietary protein content and improve the efficiency of their nutrient utilization, growth, and production performance.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundDue to high neutral lipids accumulation in the cytoplasm, in vitro-produced embryos from Bos primigenius indicus and their crosses are more sensitive to chilling and cryopreservation than those from Bos primigenius taurus.

Bovine zygotes (n\\u2009=\\u20091,692) were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: 1) Control, zygotes cultured in Charles Rosenkrans 2 amino acid (CR2aa) medium (n\\u2009=\\u2009815) or 2) CLA, zygotes cultured in CR2aa medium supplemented with 100\\u2009μmol/L of trans- 10, cis-12 CLA (n\\u2009=\\u2009877). Embryo development (cleavage and blastocyst rates evaluated at days 3 and 8 of culture, respectively), lipid content at morula stage (day 5) and blastocyst cryotolerance (re-expansion and hatching rates, evaluated 24 and 72\\u2009h post-thawing, respectively) were compared between groups. Additionally, selected mRNA transcripts were measured by Real–Time PCR in blastocyst stage.ResultsThe CLA treatment had no effect on cleavage and blastocyst rates, or on mRNA levels for genes related to cellular stress and apoptosis. On the other hand, abundance of mRNA for the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate 0-acyltransferase-encoding gene (AGPAT), which is involved in triglycerides synthesis, and consequently neutral lipid content, were reduced by CLA treatment. A significant increase was observed in the re-expansion rate of embryos cultured with trans-10, cis- 12 CLA when compared to control (56.3 vs. 34.4%, respectively, P\\u2009=\\u20090.002).

However, a possible improvement in embryo cryotolerance in response to CLA, as suggested by increased blastocyst re-expansion rate, was not confirmed by hatching rates.',\n",

The liver is the principal organ of the regulation of lipid metabolism, and this study used massive parallelized high-throughput sequencing technologies to determine the porcine liver tissue transcriptome architecture of two full-sibling Songliao black pigs harboring extremely different phenotypes of backfat thickness.ResultsThe total number of reads produced for each sample was in the region of 53 million, and 8,226 novel transcripts were detected. Approximately 92 genes were differentially regulated in the liver tissue, while 31 spliced transcripts and 33 primary transcripts showed significantly differential expression between pigs with higher and lower backfat thickness. Genes that were differentially expressed were involved in the metabolism of various substances, small molecule biochemistry, and molecular transport.ConclusionsGenes involved in the regulation of lipids could play an important role in lipid and fatty acid metabolism in the liver.

It is believed that along with biodiesel from algae, the high protein de-oiled algal residue may become an alternative feed supplement option in the future. This study was conducted to investigate de-oiled algal residue obtained from the common Chlorella species, Thalassiosira weissflogii, Selenarstrum capricornutum, Scenedesmus sp., and Scenedesmus dimorphus for assessment as potential feed supplements for ruminants by comparing with soybean (Glycine max) meal and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay.ResultsWith the exception of T. weissflogii, algal residue had higher concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Mn and lower concentration of Ca, Mg, and K than soybean meal and alfalfa hay. The algal residue CP (crude protein) concentrations ranged from 140 to 445\\xa0g/kg DM and varied among the de-oiled residues. In vitro rumen fermentation gas accumulation curves indicated that algal biomass degradation potential was less than that of soybean meal or alfalfa hay by up to 41.7%.The gas production curve, interpreted with a dual pool logistic model, confirmed that the fraction sizes for fast fermenting and slow fermenting of de-oiled algal residues were smaller than those in soybean meal and alfalfa hay, and the fermenting rate of the fractions was also low.ConclusionsInferior in vitro rumen gas accumulation from the five de-oiled algal residues suggests that these algal byproducts are less degradable in the rumen.',\n",

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of reduced energy density of close-up diets on dry matter intake (DMI), lactation performance and energy balance (EB) in multiparous Holstein cows which were housed in a free-stall barn and fed for ad libitum intake. Thirty-nine dry cows were blocked and assigned randomly to three groups fed a high energy density diet [HD, n\\u2009=\\u200913; 6.8\\xa0MJ of net energy for lactation (NEL)/kg; 14.0% crude protein (CP) ], or a middle energy density diet (MD, n\\u2009=\\u200913; 6.2\\xa0MJ NEL/kg; 14.0% CP), or a low energy density diet (LD, n\\u2009=\\u200913; 5.4\\xa0MJ NEL/kg; 14.0% CP) from d 21 before expected day of calving. After parturition, all cows were fed the same lactation diet to d 70 in milk (DIM). The DMI and NEL intake prepartum were decreased by the reduced energy density diets (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The LD group consumed 1.3\\xa0kg/d (DM) more diet compared with HD group in the last 24\\xa0h before calving. The milk yield and the postpartum DMI were increased by the reduced energy density diet prepartum (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).

       " 'BackgroundFatty acid (FA) composition is the most important parameter affecting the flavor and nutritional value of the meat. The final and the only committed step in the biosynthesis of triglycerides is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). The role of DGAT2 in lipid accumulation has been demonstrated in adipocytes, However, little is known about the effect of DGAT2 on the FA composition of these cells.MethodsTo investigate the role of DGAT2 in regulating lipid accumulation, FA composition and the expression of adipogenic genes, we cloned the open reading frame of the porcine DGAT2 gene and established 3T3-L1 cells that overexpressed DGAT2. Cells were then cultured in differentiation medium (DM) without FA, with a mixture of FAs (FA-DM), or containing a 13C stable isotope-labeled FA mixture (IFA-DM). The FA composition of adipocytes was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Quantitative PCR and western blotting were employed to detect expression of adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured with FA-DM for 12 d.ResultsThe triacylglyceride (TAG) content was significantly higher in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells. When cultured in DM or FA-DM for 12 d, cells overexpressing DGAT2 showed a higher proportion of unsaturated FAs (C16:1 and C18:1). However, when cells overexpressing DGAT2 were cultured with FA-DM for 30\\xa0min, the FA composition was almost identical to that of controls. Further, the proportion of stable isotope-labeled FAs were similar in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing DGAT2 and control cells cultured in IFA-DM for 12 d. These results collectively indicate that the higher proportion of mono-unsaturated FAs, C16:1 and C18:1, may originate from de novo FA synthesis but not from the uptake of specific FAs from the medium. This hypothesis is further supported by evidence that both mRNA and protein expression of genes involved in FA synthesis (ACACA, FASN, SCD1, and A-FABP) were significantly higher in cells overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our study revealed that TAG accumulation, the proportion of MUFAs, and the expression of adipogenic genes were higher in 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe importance of non-glucose carbohydrates, especially mannose and inositol, for normal development is increasingly recognized. Whether pregnancies complicated by abnormal glucose transfer to the fetus also affect the regulation of non-glucose carbohydrates is unknown. In pregnant sheep, maternal insulin infusions were used to reduce glucose supply to the fetus for both short (2-wk) and long (8-wk) durations to test the hypothesis that a maternal insulin infusion would suppress fetal mannose and inositol concentrations. We also used direct fetal insulin infusions (1-wk hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp) to determine the relative importance of fetal glucose and insulin for regulating non-glucose carbohydrates.ResultsA maternal insulin infusion resulted in lower maternal (50%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and fetal (35-45%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) mannose concentrations, which were highly correlated (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.69, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). A fetal insulin infusion resulted in a 50% reduction of fetal mannose (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Neither maternal nor fetal plasma inositol changed with exogenous insulin infusions. Additionally, maternal insulin infusion resulted in lower fetal sorbitol and fructose (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).ConclusionsChronically decreased glucose supply to the fetus as well as fetal hyperinsulinemia both reduce fetal non-glucose carbohydrates. Given the role of these carbohydrates in protein glycosylation and lipid production, more research on their metabolism in pregnancies complicated by abnormal glucose metabolism is clearly warranted.',\n",

Twelve growing barrows (initial body weight: 76.1\\u2009±\\u20096.2\\xa0kg) were randomly allotted to a replicated 6 × 4 Youden square design with 6 diets and 4 periods. The fat content of the 3 sources of DDGS were 11.5, 7.5, and 6.9% respectively. Diets contained 60% DDGS and fat concentration of the diets were 7.5, 5.2, and 5.2%, respectively. Two additional diets containing the 2 sources of DDGS with 7.5 and 6.9% fat were also formulated, and corn oil was added to these diets to increase the concentration of fat in the diets to levels that were calculated to be similar to the diet containing conventional DDGS with 11.5% fat. A N-free diet was also formulated to calculate endogenous losses of crude protein (CP) and AA from the pigs. Pigs were fed experimental diets during four 7-d periods. The first 5 d of each period were an adaptation period and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. The apparent ileal digestibililty (AID) and SID of CP and all indispensable AA, except AID Pro and SID of Trp, were greater (P < 0.01) in conventional DDGS than in the 2 sources of DDGS with reduced fat. Adding oil to the diets containing the 2 sources of DDGS with reduced fat did not consistently increase SID of AA. In conclusion, conventional DDGS has greater SID values for most AA compared with DDGS that contains less fat and inclusion of additional oil to diets containing low-fat DDGS does not increase AID or SID of AA. The lower AA digestibility in low-fat DDGS could not be overcome by the inclusion of additional fat to the diets.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundTo compare the nutritional value and digestibility of five quality protein maize (QPM) hybrids to that of white and yellow maize, two experiments were carried out in growing pigs. In experiment 1, the energy metabolizability and the nitrogen balance of growing pigs fed one of five QPM hybrid diets were compared against those of pigs fed white or yellow maize. In experiment 2, the apparent and standardized ileal digestibility (AID and SID, respectively) of proteins and amino acids from the five QPM hybrids were compared against those obtained from pigs fed white and yellow maize. In both experiments, the comparisons were conducted using contrasts.ResultsThe dry matter and nitrogen intakes were higher in the pigs fed the QPM hybrids (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) than in the pigs fed white or yellow maize. Energy digestibility (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and metabolizability (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) were higher in the pigs fed the white and yellow maize diets than in those fed the QPM diets. The AID of lysine was higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) in the QPM diets than in the white and yellow maize. The AIDs of leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, and methionine were lower in the QPM diets than those of maize (white and yellow) (all P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Maize (white and yellow) had greater SIDs of leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, serine, alanine, tyrosine, and proline (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).ConclusionsBased on these results, it was concluded that QPM had a lower metabolizable energy content and a higher amount of digestible lysine than normal maize.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundEstradiol (E2) is required for luteolysis in cows and its injection stimulates prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) release. The main goal of our study was to investigate the ability of endometrial explants and cells treated with E2 and the calcium ionophore (CI) A23187 to synthesize PGF2α.ResultsTreatment with E2in vivo resulted in a 48.4% increase of PGF2α production by endometrial explants treated in vitro with A23187. Production of PGF2α was better stimulated with A23187 at concentrations of 10-6 and 10-5 mol/L compared with other concentrations used. The concentration of PGF2α for untreated bovine endometrial cell cultures was 33.1 pg/mL, while for cultures treated with E2, A23187, or a combination of E2 and A23187, the PGF2α concentration was 32.5, 92.4 and 145.6 pg/mL, respectively.ConclusionsTreatment with A23187 tended to stimulate PGF2α production. In the presence of E2, A23187 significantly stimulated PGF2α synthesis. It appears that A23187 potentiates the effects of E2 with respect to synthesis of endometrial PGF2α in cattle.',\n",

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of S. cerevisiae (SC) on fiber degradation and rumen microbial populations in steers fed diets with different levels of dietary concentrate. Ten Simmental\\u2009×\\u2009Local crossbred steers (450\\u2009±\\u200950\\xa0kg BW) were assigned to a control group or an SC group. Both groups were fed the same basal diet but the SC group received SC supplementation (8\\u2009×\\u2009109\\xa0cfu/h/d through the ruminal fistula) following a two-period crossover design. Each period consisted of four phases, each of which lasted 17\\xa0d: 10\\xa0d for dietary adaptation, 6\\xa0d for degradation study, and 1\\xa0d for rumen sample collection. From the 1st to the 4th phase, steers were fed in a stepwise fashion with increasing CTFRs, i.e., 30:70, 50:50, 70:30, and 90:10. The kinetics of dry matter and fiber degradation of alfalfa pellets were evaluated; the rumen microbial populations were detected using real-time PCR. The results revealed no significant (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05) interactions between dietary CTFR and SC for most parameters. Dietary CTFR had a significant effect (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) on degradation characteristics of alfalfa pellets and the copies of rumen microorganism; the increasing concentrate level resulted in linear, quadratic or cubic variation trend for these parameters. SC supplementation significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) affected dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradation rates (cDM, cNDF) and NDF effective degradability (EDNDF). Compared with the control group, there was an increasing trend of rumen fungi and protozoa in SC group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.1); copies of total bacteria in SC group were significantly higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, percentage of Ruminobacter amylophilus was significantly lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) but percentage of Selenomonas ruminantium was significantly higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in the SC group. In a word, dietary CTFR had a significant effect on degradation characteristics of forage and rumen microbial population. S. cerevisiae had positive effects on DM and NDF degradation rate or effective degradability of forage; S. cerevisiae increased rumen total bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and lactate-utilizing bacteria but reduced starch-degrading and lactate-producing bacteria.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPhosphorus (P) supplementation is costly and can result in excess P excretion. This study investigated the effects of reducing dietary P on milk production and P excretion in dairy cows over a full lactation.MethodForty-five multiparous Holstein dairy cows were divided into 15 blocks according to expected calving date and previous milk yield, and assigned randomly to one of the three dietary treatments: 0.37, 0.47, and 0.57% P (DM basis); these P levels represent the NRC recommendations, Chinese recommendations, and the amount of dietary P commonly fed by Chinese dairy farmers, respectively. Average daily feed intake was calculated from monthly data on feed offered and refused. Milk yields of individual cows were recorded weekly, and milk samples were taken for analysis of protein, fat, solids-not-fat, lactose, and somatic cell count. Blood samples were collected on days −6, −3, 0, 3, 6 relative to calving, and then monthly throughout lactation, and analyzed for P and Ca concentrations. Spot samples of feces and urine were collected for 3 consecutive d during weeks 12, 24, and 36, and P concentrations were analyzed. Reproduction and health data were recorded.ResultsDietary P did not affect dry matter intake or milk yield (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10). Milk fat content was slightly higher in cows fed 0.37% P than in cows fed 0.47% P (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05). Serum concentrations of P and Ca did not reflect dietary P content (P\\u2009>\\u20090.10). Fecal and urinary P both declined linearly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) as dietary P decreased from 0.57 to 0.37%. Fecal P content was 25% less when dietary P was 0.37% compared to 0.57%. Health events and reproductive performance were not associated with dietary P content (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05).ConclusionsLowering dietary P from 0.57 to 0.37% did not negatively affect milk production, but did significantly reduce P excretion into environment.',\n",
       " 'Commercial milking of sheep is a new agricultural industry in the United States starting approximately 30\\xa0yr ago. The industry is still small, but it is growing. The majority of the sheep milk is used in the production of specialty cheeses. The United States is the major importer of sheep milk cheeses with 50 to 60% of annual world exports coming to the United States during the past 20\\xa0yr. Therefore, there is considerable growth potential for the industry in the United States. The only dairy sheep research flock in North America is located at the Spooner Agricultural Research Station of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The research program started in 1993 and has been multifaceted; dealing with several areas important to commercial dairy sheep farmers. The East Friesian and Lacaune dairy breeds were compared and introduced to the industry through the research program. Both dairy breeds produced significantly more milk than traditional meat-wool breeds found in the U.S., but the two breeds differed in their production traits. East Friesian-cross ewes produced more lambs and slightly more milk than Lacaune-cross ewes whereas Lacaune-cross ewes produced milk with a higher percentage of fat and protein than East Friesian-cross ewes. Lactation physiology studies have shown that ewes with active corpora lutea have increased milk yields, oxytocin release during milking is required to obtain normal fat percentages in the milk, large udder cisterns of dairy ewes can allow for increased milking intervals, and short daylengths during late pregnancy results in increased milk yield. In the nutrition area, legume-grass pastures and forages with a higher percentage of legume will result in increased milk production. Grazing ewes respond to additional supplementation with increased milk yield, but it is important to match the supplement to the quality of the grazing. Ewes on high quality legume-grass pastures that are high in rumen degradable protein respond with increased milk production to supplements high in energy and/or high in rumen undegraded protein.',\n",

The treatments were - (1) high energy/low protein (HELP), (2) high energy/high protein (HEHP), (3) low energy/low protein (LELP) and (4) low energy/high protein (LEHP). Each treatment used 6 steers and 6 heifers, except for HELP- 5 steers and 6 heifers.ResultsGrowth rate and final carcass weight were unaffected by dietary energy and protein levels or by sex. Compared with the LE diet group, the HE group had significantly lower dry matter intake (DMI, 6.76 vs. 7.48\\xa0kg DM/d), greater chest girth increments (46.1 vs. 36.8\\xa0cm), higher carcass fat (19.9 vs.16.3%) and intramuscular fat content (29.9 vs. 22.8% DM). The HE group also had improved yields of top and medium top grade commercial meat cuts (39.9 vs.36.5%). The dressing percentage was higher for the HP group than the LP group (53.4 vs. 54.9%). Steers had a greater length increment (9.0 vs. 8.3\\xa0cm), but lower carcass fat content (16.8 vs. 19.4%) than heifers. The meat quality traits (shear force value, drip loss, cooking loss and water holding capacity) were not affected by treatments or sex, averaging 3.14\\xa0kg, 2.5, 31.5 and 52.9%, respectively. The nutritive profiles (both fatty and amino acid composition) were not influenced by the energy or protein levels or by sex.ConclusionsThe dietary energy and protein levels and sex significantly influenced the carcass characteristics and chemical composition of meat but not thegrowth performance, meat quality traits and nutritive profiles.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundConsuming moderate amounts of lean red meat as part of a balanced diet valuably contributes to intakes of essential nutrients. In this study, we merged phenotypic and genotypic information to characterize the variation in lipid profile and sensory parameters and to represent the diversity among 15 cattle populations. Correlations between fat content, organoleptic characteristics and lipid profiles were also investigated.MethodsA sample of 436 largely unrelated purebred bulls belonging to 15 breeds and reared under comparable management conditions was analyzed. Phenotypic data -including fatness score, fat percentage, individual fatty acids (FA) profiles and sensory panel tests- and genotypic information from 11 polymorphisms was used.ResultsThe correlation coefficients between muscle total lipid measurements and absolute vs. relative amounts of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were in opposite directions. Increasing carcass fat leads to an increasing amount of FAs in triglycerides, but at the same time the relative amount of PUFAs is decreasing, which is in concordance with the negative correlation obtained here between the percentage of PUFA and fat measurements, as well as the weaker correlation between total phospholipids and total lipid muscle content compared with neutral lipids. Concerning organoleptic characteristics, a negative correlation between flavour scores and the percentage of total PUFA, particularly to n-6 fraction, was found. The correlation between juiciness and texture is higher than with flavour scores. The distribution of SNPs plotted by principal components analysis (PCA) mainly reflects their known trait associations, although influenced by their specific breed allele frequencies.ConclusionsThe results presented here help to understand the phenotypic and genotypic background underlying variations in FA composition and sensory parameters between breeds. The wide range of traits and breeds studied, along with the genotypic information on polymorphisms previously associated with different lipid traits, provide a broad characterization of beef meat, which allows giving a better response to the variety of consumers’ preferences. Also, the development and implementation of low-density SNP panels with predictive value for economically important traits, such as those summarized here, may be used to improve production efficiency and meat quality in the beef industry.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundAt present, vitrification has been widely applied to humans, mice and farm animals. To improve the efficiency of vitrification in straw, bovine oocytes were used to test a new two-step vitrification method in this study.ResultsWhen in vitro matured oocytes were exposed to 20% ethylene glycol (EG20) for 5\\xa0min and 40% ethylene glycol (EG40) for 30\\xa0s, followed by treatment with 30% glycerol (Gly30), Gly40 or Gly50, a volume expansion was observed in Gly30 and Gly40 but not Gly50. This indicates that the intracellular osmotic pressure after a 30\\xa0s differs between EG40 and ranged between Gly40 (approximately 5.6\\xa0mol/L) and Gly50 (approximately 7.0\\xa0mol/L). Since oocytes are in EG40 just for only a short period of time (30\\xa0s) and at a lower temperature (4°C), we hypothesize that the main function of this step in to induce dehydration. Based on these results, we omitted the EG40 step, before oocytes were pretreated in EG20 for 5\\xa0min, exposed to pre-cooled (4°C) Gly50, for 30\\xa0s, and then dipped into liquid nitrogen. After warming, 81.1% of the oocytes survived, and the surviving oocytes developed into cleavage stage embryos (63.5%) or blastocysts (20.0%) after parthenogenetic activation.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that in a two-step vitrification procedure, the permeability effect in the second step is not necessary. It is possible that the second step is only required to provide adequate osmotic pressure to condense the intracellular concentration of CPAs to a level required for successful vitrification.',\n",

The experiment examined corn variety (LS1, LS2, LS3 and LS4) grown in one location, drying method (sun dried and artificially dried) and different drying temperatures. Corn harvested at 20-25% moisture was dried to about 12% moisture by sun drying and artificially drying at 80, 100, or 120°C in a fluidized bed dryer. Ninety-six barrows (average BW of 33.4\\u2009±\\u20092.7\\xa0kg) were housed in individual metabolism crates to facilitate separate collection of feces and urine. A five-day collection period followed a seven-day diet acclimation period.ResultsThe results indicated that variety significantly influenced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) the 1,000 kernel weight of corn but not the bulk weight. Variety also influenced the available energy content (digestible energy of dry matter, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01; metabolisable energy of dry matter, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and digestibility of organic matter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), as well as dry matter (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and gross energy (GE) content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.02). The drying method of corn significantly influenced the 1,000 kernel weight (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01), bulk weight (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and digestibility of ether extract (EE) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).

In this study, we investigated the changes in plasma metabolites and immune responses in piglets in response to the stress induced by weaning and Escherichia coli challenge.ResultsFecal dry matter decreased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.003) and nearly half (44.4%) the piglets developed diarrhea on day 2 and 3 postweaning. The concentration of plasma immunoglobulin A was higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) on day 11 postweaning than on day 0 or 4 postweaning. The levels of white blood cells increased continuously (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) from day 0 to day 11 postweaning. Differences in the percentages of neutrophils (P\\u2009=\\u20090.029) and lymphocytes (P\\u2009=\\u20090.022) were seen, but the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio did not differ in the period after weaning. A clear separation of the metabolomic profile data for day 0 and day 4 postweaning was observed with a principal components analysis (PCA) scores plot, and the data for day 11 were located between those for day 0 and day 4 postweaning. The plasma levels of proline, taurine, and carnitine were higher, whereas those of betaine, creatine, L-arginine and acetylcarnitine were lower on day 4 postweaning than on day 0. Levels of lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine were either higher or lower after weaning, depending on the chain lengths or characters of these metabolites.ConclusionsOur results show a clear separation in the plasma metabolomic profiles of piglets that corresponded to the fecal responses to stress on the piglets induced by weaning or exposure to a pathogen (E. coli). These plasma metabolite profiles suggest that the challenges induced proinflammatory responses in the piglets, resulting in postweaning diarrhea, which was associated with higher concentrations of IgA in the plasma.',\n",

       " 'Dietary fiber is associated with impaired nutrient utilization and reduced net energy values. However, fiber has to be included in the diet to maintain normal physiological functions in the digestive tract. Moreover, the negative impact of dietary fiber will be determined by the fiber properties and may differ considerably between fiber sources. Various techniques can be applied to enhance nutritional value and utilization of available feed resources. In addition, the extent of fiber utilization is affected by the age of the pig and the pig breed. The use of potential prebiotic effects of dietary fiber is an attractive way to stimulate gut health and thereby minimize the use of anti-microbial growth promoters. Inclusion of soluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in the diet can stimulate the growth of commensal gut microbes. Inclusion of NSP from chicory results in changes in gut micro-environment and gut morphology of pigs, while growth performance remains unaffected and digestibility was only marginally reduced. The fermentation products and pH in digesta responded to diet type and were correlated with shifts in the microbiota. Interestingly, fiber intake will have an impact on the expression of intestinal epithelial heat-shock proteins in the pig. Heat-shock proteins have an important physiological role in the gut and carry out crucial housekeeping functions in order to maintain the mucosal barrier integrity. Thus, there are increasing evidence showing that fiber can have prebiotic effects in pigs due to interactions with the gut micro-environment and the gut associated immune system.',\n",

       " 'Immune system activation begins a host of physiological responses. Infectious agents are recognized by monocytes and macrophages which in turn stimulate cytokine production. It is the hormone-like factors called cytokines that orchestrate the immune response. The classic responses observed with immune system activation and cytokine production include: anorexia, fever, lethargy, recruitment of other immune cells, and phagocytosis. While production of immune system components is known to require some amino acids, increases in amino acid requirements are more than offset by the associated decrease in protein accretion and increased muscle protein degradation that also accompanies immune system activation. However, the biggest impact of cytokine production is a decrease in feed intake. Therefore, as feed intake decreases, the energy needed to drive protein synthesis is also decreased. This suggests that diets should still be formulated on a similar calorie:lysine ratio as those formulated for non-immune challenged pigs. The evidence is sparse or equivocal for increasing nutrient requirements during an immune challenge. Nutritionists and swine producers should resist the pressure to alter the diet, limit feed, or add expensive feed additives during an immune challenge. While immune stimulation does not necessitate changes in diet formulation, when pigs are challenged with non-pathogenic diarrhea there are potential advantages on gut health with the increased use of crystalline amino acids rather than intact protein sources (i.e., soybean meal). This is because reducing crude protein decreases the quantity of fermentable protein entering the large intestine, which lowers post weaning diarrhea. It also lowers the requirement for expensive specialty protein sources or other protein sources such as soybean meal that present immunological challenges to the gut. The objective of this review is two-fold. The first is to discuss immunity by nutrition interactions, or lack thereof, and secondly, to review amino acid requirement estimates for nursery pigs.',\n",

To prevent unforeseen reductions in growth performance, grading and analytical methods are used to minimize nutrient variability between calculated and analyzed values. This experiment was carried out to define the sources of variation in the energy content of corn and to develop a practical method to accurately estimate the digestible energy (DE) and metabolisable energy (ME) content of individual corn samples for growing pigs. Twenty samples were taken from each of five provinces in China (Jilin, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, and Henan) to obtain a range of quality.ResultsThe DE and ME contents of the 100 corn samples were measured in 35.3\\u2009±\\u20091.92\\xa0kg growing pigs (six pigs per corn sample). Sixty corn samples were used to build the prediction model; the remaining forty samples were used to test the suitability of these models.

       " 'Hypoxia is a physiological or pathological condition of a deficiency of oxygen supply in the body as a whole or within a tissue. During hypoxia, tissues undergo a series of physiological responses to defend themselves against a low oxygen supply, including increased angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose uptake. The effects of hypoxia are mainly mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which is a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of α and β subunits. HIF-1β is constantly expressed, whereas HIF-1α is degraded under normal oxygen conditions. Hypoxia stabilizes HIF-1α and the HIF complex, and HIF then translocates into the nucleus to initiate the expression of target genes. Hypoxia has been extensively studied for its role in promoting tumor progression, and emerging evidence also indicates that hypoxia may play important roles in physiological processes, including mammary development and lactation. The mammary gland exhibits an increasing metabolic rate from pregnancy to lactation to support mammary growth, lactogenesis, and lactation. This process requires increasing amounts of oxygen consumption and results in localized chronic hypoxia as confirmed by the binding of the hypoxia marker pimonidazole HCl in mouse mammary gland. We hypothesized that this hypoxic condition promotes mammary development and lactation, a hypothesis that is supported by the following several lines of evidence: i) Mice with an HIF-1α deletion selective for the mammary gland have impaired mammary differentiation and lipid secretion, resulting in lactation failure and striking changes in milk compositions; ii) We recently observed that hypoxia significantly induces HIF-1α-dependent glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression in mammary epithelial cells, which may be responsible for the dramatic increases in glucose uptake and GLUT1 expression in the mammary gland during the transition period from late pregnancy to early lactation; and iii) Hypoxia and HIF-1α increase the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 5a (STAT5a) in mammary epithelial cells, whereas STAT5 phosphorylation plays important roles in the regulation of milk protein gene expression and mammary development. Based on these observations, hypoxia effects emerge as a new frontier for studying the regulation of mammary development and lactation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe rapid gain in lean mass in neonates requires greater rates of protein synthesis than degradation. We previously delineated the molecular mechanisms by which insulin and amino acids, especially leucine, modulate skeletal muscle protein synthesis and how this changes with development. In the current study, we identified mechanisms involved in protein degradation regulation. In experiment 1, 6- and 26-d-old pigs were studied during 1) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic, 2) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-hyperaminoacidemic, and 3) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic clamps for 2\\xa0h. In experiment 2, 5-d-old pigs were studied during 1) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic-euleucinemic, 2) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-hypoaminoacidemic-hyperleucinemic, and 3) euinsulinemic-euglycemic-euaminoacidemic-hyperleucinemic clamps for 24\\xa0h. We determined in muscle indices of ubiquitin-proteasome, i.e., atrogin-1 (MAFbx) and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF1) and autophagy-lysosome systems, i.e., unc51-like kinase 1 (UKL1), microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (Lamp-2). For comparison, we measured ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) activation, components of translation initiation.ResultsAbundance of atrogin-1, but not MuRF1, was greater in 26- than 6-d-old pigs and was not affected by insulin, amino acids, or leucine. Abundance of ULK1 and LC3 was higher in younger pigs and not affected by treatment. The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was reduced and ULK1 phosphorylation increased by insulin, amino acids, and leucine. These responses were more profound in younger pigs. Abundance of Lamp-2 was not affected by treatment or development. Abundance of eIF4E, but not rpS6, was higher in 6- than 26-d-old-pigs but unaffected by treatment. Phosphorylation of eIF4E was not affected by treatment, however, insulin, amino acids, and leucine stimulated rpS6 phosphorylation, and the responses decreased with development.ConclusionsThe rapid growth of neonatal muscle is in part due to the positive balance between the activation of protein synthesis and degradation signaling. Insulin, amino acids, and, particularly, leucine, act as signals to modulate muscle protein synthesis and degradation in neonates.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe potential for acid-detergent insoluble ash (ADIA), alkaline-peroxide lignin (APL), and acid-detergent lignin (ADL) to predict fecal output (FO) and dry matter digestibility (DMD) by cattle offered bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] hays of different qualities was evaluated. Eight ruminally cannulated cows (594\\u2009±\\u200935.5\\xa0kg) were allocated randomly to 4 hay diets: low (L), medium low (ML), medium high (MH), and high (H) crude protein (CP) concentration (79, 111, 131, and 164\\xa0g CP/kg on a DM basis, respectively). Diets were offered in 3 periods with 2 diet replicates per period and were rotated across cows between periods. Cows were individually fed 20\\xa0g DM/kg of body weight in equal feedings at 08:00 and 16:00\\xa0h for a 10-d adaptation followed by a 5-d total fecal collection. Actual DM intake (DMI), DMD, and FO were determined based on hay offered, ort, and feces excreted. These components were then analyzed for ADL, APL, and ADIA concentration to determine marker recovery and marker-based estimates of FO and DMD.ResultsForage DMI was affected by diet (P =\\u20090.02), and DMI from MH and H was greater (P <\\u20090.05) than from L. Apparent DMD tended (P =\\u20090.08) to differ among diets while FO (P =\\u20090.20) was not affected by diet treatments. Average ADL recovery (1.16) was greater (P <\\u20090.05) than that of ADIA (1.03) and APL (1.06), but ADIA and APL did not differ (P =\\u20090.42). Estimates of FO and DMD derived using APL and ADIA were not different (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.05) from total fecal collection while those using ADL differed (P <\\u20090.05). There was no diet by marker interaction (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.22) for either FO or DMD.ConclusionAcid-detergent insoluble ash and APL accurately predicted FO and DMD of cattle fed bermudagrass hay of varying nutrient composition. These internal markers may facilitate studies involving large numbers of animals and forages. Results from such studies may be used to develop improved equations to predict energy values of forages based on the relationship of dietary components to digestibility across a wide range of forages.',\n",
       " 'To investigate the effects of different sources of carbohydrates on intake, digestibility, chewing, and performance, nine lactating Holstein dairy cows (day in milk= 100±21 d; body weight=645.7 ± 26.5\\xa0kg) were allotted to a 3 × 3 Latin square design at three 23-d periods. The three treatments included 34.91% (B), 18.87% (BC), and 18.86% (BB) barley that in treatment B was partially replaced with only corn or corn plus beet pulp in treatments BC and BB, respectively. The concentration of starch and neutral detergent soluble carbohydrate varied (22.2, 20.2, and 14.5; 13.6, 15.9, and 20.1% of DM in treatments B, BC, and BB, respectively). Cows in treatment BB showed a higher DMI and improved digestibility of DM, NDF, and EE compared with treatments B or BC. Ruminal pH was higher in cows fed on BB (6.83) compared with those that received B or BC treatments (6.62 and 6.73, respectively). A lower proportion of propionate accompanied the higher pH in the BB group; however, a greater proportion of acetate and acetate: propionate ratio was observed compared with cows fed either on the B or BC diet. Moreover, cows fed on the BB diet showed the lowest ruminal passage rate and longest ruminal and total retention time. Eating time did not differ among treatments, rumination time was greater among cows fed on the BB diet compared with the others, whereas total chewing activity was greater than those fed on BC, but similar to those fed on B. The treatments showed no effect on milk yield. Partially replacing barley with corn or beet pulp resulted in an increase in milk fat and a lower protein concentration. Changing dietary NFC with that of a different degradability thus altered intake, chewing activity, ruminal environment, retention time or passage rate, and lactation performance. The results of this study showed that beet pulp with a higher NDF and a detergent-soluble carbohydrate or pectin established a more consistent ruminal mat than barley and corn, thus resulting in higher mean retention time and chewing activity, whereas no changes in 3.5% FCM and milk fat were observed.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundHematologic and biochemical reference intervals depend on many factors, including age. A review of the literature highlights the lack of reference intervals for 6-wk-old specific pathogen free (SPF) Hampshire-Yorkshire crossbred pigs. For translational research, 6-wk-old pigs represent an important animal model for both human juvenile colitis and diabetes mellitus type 2 given the similarities between the porcine and human gastrointestinal maturation process. The aim of this study was to determine reference intervals for hematological and biochemical parameters in healthy 6-wk-old crossbred pigs. Blood samples were collected from 66 clinically healthy Hampshire-Yorkshire pigs. The pigs were 6 wks old, represented both sexes, and were housed in a SPF facility. Automated hematological and biochemical analysis were performed using an ADVIA 120 Hematology System and a Cobas 6000 C501 Clinical Chemistry Analyzer.ResultsReference intervals were calculated using both parametric and nonparametric methods. The mean, median, minimum, and maximum values were calculated.ConclusionAs pigs are used more frequently as medical models of human disease, having reference intervals for commonly measured hematological and biochemical parameters in 6-wk-old pigs will be useful. The reference intervals calculated in this study will aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of both naturally occurring and experimentally induced disease. In comparison to published reference intervals for older non SPF pigs, notable differences in leukocyte populations, and in levels of sodium, potassium, glucose, protein, and alkaline phosphatase were observed.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThis study was to determine if feeding laying hens with defatted diatom microalgal biomass (DFA) from biofuel production affected their egg production and health status.MethodsFive replicates of 5 individually caged ISA Babcock White leghorn hens were fed 4 diets, including a corn-soybean meal control diet, a diet containing 7.5% DFA substituting for soybean meal, and diets containing 7.5% or 15% DFA substituting for corn and soybean meal. Body weights, feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), rate of egg production, egg size, egg mass, and several characteristics of eggs were determined at 4 and 8 wk. Venous blood was sampled at 4 and 8 wk for measurement of 5 biomarkers of health.ResultsThe 15% DFA diet decreased (P <\\u20090.05) feed intake, egg production, and plasma uric acid concentrations as compared with the control diet, but increased (P <\\u20090.05) egg albumen weight and height compared with the 7.5% DFA diets. The two levels of DFA produced dose-dependent (P <\\u20090.05) changes in three color measures of egg yolk, without affecting four hen plasma biochemical indicators of health.ConclusionsFeeding laying hens with 7.5% DFA in the corn-soybean meal diet for 8 wk had no adverse effect on their health, egg production, or egg quality, but 15% inclusion reduced feed intake, egg production, and efficiency of feed utilization.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundSalmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE), as a major cause of foodborn illness, infects humans mainly through the egg. However, the symptom of laying hens usually is not typical and hard to diagnosis. In the present study, it is studied that the influences of SE infection on layers’ performance, egg quality and blood biochemical indicators. It will help us to improve the strategy to control SE infection in commercial layers. One hundred layers at 20 wk of age were divided into 2 groups, 60 hens for experiment and others for control. The experiment group was fed with the dosage of 108\\xa0CFU SE per hen. The specific PCR was used to detect the deposition of SE. On the 8 d after SE infection, 10 hens from the control group and 30 hens from the experimental group were slaughtered to detect the SE colonization. The production performance, egg quality and blood biochemical indices were also analyzed.ResultsThe results showed that the colonization rate of SE was highest in caecum contents (55.17%) and lowest in vagina (17.24%). For the eggs the detection rate of SE was highest on the eggshell (80.00%) and lowest in yolk (18.81%). SE infection had no significant influence on production performance and egg qualities (P > 0.05). The difference of laying rate between the experimental and control groups was less than 0.30%, and both were approximately equal to 82.00%. The blood analysis showed that the aspartic aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of experimental group was significantly higher than those of control group (P < 0.05). For experimental and control groups AST values were 236.22 U/l and 211.84 U/l respectively, and ALT values were 32.19 U/l and 24.55 U/l. All of coefficients were less than 20%. The colonization of SE in organs increases the enzyme activities of AST and ALT in blood.ConclusionsSE in feed could invade the oviduct and infect the forming eggs. It significantly increased the concentration of ALT and AST in blood. However,SE infection was hard to be observed from the appearances of layer and egg. It might be a dangerous risk to human health.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundHeifers not used as breeding stock are often implanted with steroids to increase growth efficiency thereby altering hormone profiles and potentially changing the environment in which ovarian follicles develop. Because bovine granulosa cell culture is a commonly used technique and often bovine ovaries are collected from abattoirs with no record of implant status, the objective of this study was to determine if the presence of an implant during bovine granulosa cell development impacts follicle stimulating hormone-regulated steroidogenic enzyme expression. Paired ovaries were collected from 16 feedlot heifers subjected to 1 of 3 treatments: non-implanted (n\\u2009=\\u20095), Revalor 200 for 28 d (n\\u2009=\\u20095), or Revalor 200 for 84 d (n\\u2009=\\u20096). Small follicle (1 to 5\\xa0mm) granulosa cells were isolated from each pair and incubated with phosphate buffered saline (n\\u2009=\\u200916) or 100\\xa0ng/mL follicle stimulating hormone (n\\u2009=\\u200916) for 24\\xa0h.ResultsGranulosa cells of implanted heifers treated with follicle stimulating hormone produced medium concentrations of progesterone similar (P\\u2009=\\u20090.22) to non-implanted heifers, while medium estradiol concentrations were increased (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) at 28 and 84 d compared to non-implanted heifers indicating efficacy of treatment. Additionally, real-time PCR analysis in response to follicle stimulating hormone treatment demonstrated a decrease in steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) mRNA expression in heifers implanted for 84 d and an increase in P450 side chain cleavage mRNA in granulosa cells of heifers implanted for 28 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10) or 84 d (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) compared to non-implanted females. However, no difference in expression of 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.57) and aromatase (P\\u2009=\\u20090.23) were demonstrated in implanted or non-implanted heifers.ConclusionsThese results indicate follicles which develop in the presence of high concentrations of androgenic and estrogenic steroids via an implant tend to demonstrate an altered capacity to respond to follicle stimulating hormone stimulation. Thus, efforts should be made to avoid the use of implanted heifers to study steroidogenesis in small follicle granulosa cell culture systems.',\n",

Camelina seed oil is rich in omega-3 fatty acids (>35%) and γ-tocopherol but is also high in erucic acid and glucosinolates. Camelina meal, is the by-product after the oil has been extracted. Camelina meal was fed to 28 d old weaned pigs at 3.7% and 7.4% until age 56 d. The camelina meal supplements in the soy based diets, improved feed efficiency but also significantly increased the liver weights. Gene expression analyses of the livers, using intra-species microarrays, identified increased expression of phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism enzymes. The porcine versions of the enzymes were confirmed by real time PCR. Cytochrome 8b1 (CYP8B1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Aldh2), and thiosulfate transferase (TST) were all significantly stimulated. Collectively, these genes implicate the camelina glucosinolate metabolite, methyl-sulfinyldecyl isothiocyanate, as the main xeniobiotic, causing increased hepatic metabolism and increased liver weight.',\n",
       " 'Researches on tea have been developed for decades, which prove that tea, especially green tea, has multiple functional components. With the rapid development of beverage industry, the resultant large amounts of tea grounds attract great attention. However, unreasonable utilization of tea grounds would lead to great waste and environmental pollution, especially in summer. In view of the high nutritive value and multiple functional components, tea grounds could be used as feedstuff. By now, researches of tea grounds as feedstuff are mainly on ruminant, as the utilization on other animals is limited to lower level due to high fiber content. Therefore, the following review will begin with a brief introduction of tea grounds and the possible utilization of tea grounds as feedstuff, and then elaborate on the application of ensiling and total mixed ration on ruminant. Apart from the fermentation quality, nutritive value is also provided to assess feasibilities of using tea grounds as feedstuff resources. Finally, a summary on the utilization situation and future direction of using tea grounds as feedstuff is provided in this review.',\n",
       " 'The rise in global population has led to explorations of alternative sources of energy and food. Because corn and soybean are staple food crops for humans, their common use as the main source of dietary energy and protein for food-producing animals directly competes with their allocation for human consumption. Alternatively, de-fatted marine microalgal biomass generated from the potential biofuel production may be a viable replacement of corn and soybean meal due to their high levels of protein, relatively well-balanced amino acid profiles, and rich contents of minerals and vitamins, along with unique bioactive compounds. Although the full-fatted (intact) microalgae represent the main source of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids including docohexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the de-fatted microalgal biomass may still contain good amounts of these components for enriching DHA/EPA in eggs, meats, and milk. This review is written to highlight the necessity and potential of using the de-fatted microalgal biomass as a new generation of animal feed in helping address the global energy, food, and environmental issues. Nutritional feasibility and limitation of the biomass as the new feed ingredient for simple-stomached species are elaborated. Potential applications of the biomass for generating value-added animal products are also explored.',\n",

Diarrhea score, growth performance, goblet cell size and number, bacterial translocation from intestinal lumen to lymph nodes, intestinal morphology, and relative amounts of sulfo and sialo mucins were measured. The E. coli challenge reduced performance, increased goblet cell size and number in the ileum, increased bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to the lymph nodes, and increased ileal crypt depth. One of the clays (smectite A) tended to increase goblet cell size in ileum, which may indicate enhanced protection. In conclusion, E. coli infection degrades intestinal barrier integrity but smectite A may enhance it.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe use of antibiotics in animal diets is facing negative feedback due to the hidden danger of drug residues to human health. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been used to replace antibiotics in the past two decades and played an increasingly important role in livestock production. The present study was carried out to assess the feeding effects of a traditional nourishing Chinese herbal medicine mixture on kinetics of plasma glucose, protein and energy metabolism in sheep. Ruminal fermentation characteristics were also determined.MethodsFour sheep were fed on either mixed hay (MH-diet) or MH-diet supplemented with 2% of Chinese herbal medicine (mixture of Astragalus root, Angelica root and Atractylodes rhizome; CHM-diet) over two 35-day periods using a crossover design. The turnover rate of plasma glucose was measured with an isotope dilution method using [U-13C]glucose. The rates of plasma leucine turnover and leucine oxidation, whole body protein synthesis (WBPS) and metabolic heat production were measured using the [1-13C]leucine dilution and open circuit calorimetry.ResultsBody weight gain of sheep was higher (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) for CHM-diet than for MH-diet. Rumen pH was lower (P\\u2009=\\u20090.02), concentration of rumen total volatile fatty acid tended to be higher (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) and acetate was higher (P\\u2009=\\u20090.04) for CHM-diet than for MH-diet. Turnover rates of plasma glucose and leucine did not differ between diets. Oxidation rate of leucine tended to be higher (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) for CHM-diet than for MH-diet, but the WBPS did not differ between diets. Metabolic heat production tended to be greater (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05) for CHM-diet than for MH-diet.ConclusionsThe sheep fed on CHM-diet had a higher body weight gain and showed positive impacts on rumen fermentation and energy metabolism without resulting in any adverse response. Therefore, these results suggested that the Chinese herbal medicine mixture should be considered as a potential feed additive for sheep.',\n",
       " 'Dietary fiber, resistant to host-mediated digestion in the small intestine due to lack of endogenous enzymes, impacts many facets of animal health and is associated with gut development especially in young monogastrics. Furthermore, it can be used as in-feed antibiotic alternative. Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) forage with high content of pectin (uronic acids as building blocks) is a novel class of dietary fiber that is chemically different from cereal grains (with high content of arabinoxylans). In the present study, we investigated effects of dietary inclusion of chicory forage on digestibility, gut morphology and microbiota in broilers and young pigs. In the chicken experiment, 160 1-d old broiler chicks were fed 3 nutritionally balanced diets for 30 d including a cereal-based diet and 2 diets with part of the cereals substituted with 60 and 120\\xa0g/kg chicory forage (CF60 and CF120), whereas in the pig experiment, 18 seven-wk old Yorkshire pigs were fed 3 diets for 18 d including a cereal-based diet and 2 diets with 80 and 160\\xa0g/kg chicory forage inclusion (CF80 and CF160). Our results showed that young pigs were capable to utilize chicory forage well with higher total tract apparent digestibility (TTAD) of all fiber fractions, particularly uronic acid, compared with the control (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). In contrast, a decreased TTAD of all fiber fractions was observed in chickens fed on diet CF120 (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Moreover, diet induced changes in gut morphology were observed in the large intestine of chickens. The alteration of cecal mucosal thickness was further positively correlated with TTAD of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and its constituent sugars (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In addition, in pigs, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of intestinal microbiota revealed substantial dietary effects (cereal control diet vs. chicory forage inclusion) on the relative abundance of 2 dominant bacterial phylotypes (Prevotella sp. vs. Roseburia sp.) respectively (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). In conclusion, our data showed that chicory forage (Cichorium intybus L.), a novel dietary fiber source in animal nutrition, have potential beneficial properties as fiber ingredient in diets for both pigs and chickens.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundStudies have shown clear differences between dairy breeds in their feed intake and production efficiencies. The duodenum is critical in the coordination of digestion and absorption of nutrients. This study examined gene transcript abundance of important classes of nutrient transporters in the duodenum of non lactating dairy cows of different feed efficiency potential, namely Holstein-Friesian (HF), Jersey (JE) and their F1 hybrid. Duodenal epithelial tissue was collected at slaughter and stored at -80°C. Total RNA was extracted from tissue and reverse transcribed to generate cDNA. Gene expression of the following transporters, namely nucleoside; amino acid; sugar; mineral; and lipid transporters was measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Data were statistically analysed using mixed models ANOVA in SAS. Orthogonal contrasts were used to test for potential heterotic effects and spearman correlation coefficients calculated to determine potential associations amongst gene expression values and production efficiency variables.ResultsWhile there were no direct effects of genotype on expression values for any of the genes examined, there was evidence for a heterotic effect (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on ABCG8, in the form of increased expression in the F1 genotype compared to either of the two parent breeds. Additionally, a tendency for increased expression of the amino acid transporters, SLC3A1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.072), SLC3A2 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.081) and SLC6A14 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.072) was also evident in the F1 genotype. A negative (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) association was identified between the expression of the glucose transporter gene SLC5A1 and total lactational milk solids yield, corrected for body weight. Positive correlations (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) were also observed between the expression values of genes involved in common transporter roles.ConclusionThis study suggests that differences in the expression of sterol and amino acid transporters in the duodenum could contribute towards the documented differences in feed efficiency between HF, JE and their F1 hybrid. Furthermore, positive associations between the expression of genes involved in common transporter roles suggest that these may be co-regulated. The study identifies potential candidates for investigation of genetic variants regulating nutrient transport and absorption in the duodenum in dairy cows, which may be incorporated into future breeding programmes.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundCorn silage is the main dietary component used for ruminant breeding in China and is an important dietary source of fatty acids for these animals. However, little is known regarding effective means to protect the fatty acid (FA) contents in silages. In this study, we examined the changes in FA contents and compositions during corn ensiling and screened several antioxidants for their inhibition of lipid oxidation during corn ensiling.MethodsWe conducted two different experiments. In Experiment 1, corn was ensiled in 30 polyethylene bottles (bottle volume: 1\\xa0L, silage density: 600\\xa0g/dm3) and three bottles were opened at 0.5 d, 1 d, 1.5 d, 2 d, 2.5 d, 3 d, 5 d, 7 d, 14 d, and 28 d after ensiling. In Experiment 2, corn was treated with various antioxidants: (1) No additives (CK); (2) BHA (Butylated hydroxyanisole); (3) TBHQ (Tertiary butyl hydroquinone); (4) TPP (Tea polyphenols); and (5) VE (Vitamin E). These treatments were applied at 50\\xa0mg/kg and 100\\xa0mg/kg of fresh weight with each treatment replicated 3 times.ResultsDuring ensiling in Experiment 1, saturated fatty acids (SFA; C16:0 and C18:0) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents tended to increase, whereas unsaturated fatty acids (UFA; C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3) tended to decrease. However, these changes were only significant on the first 2\\xa0days of ensiling. In Experiment 2, all of the antioxidants tested affected the total FA contents and those of unsaturated fatty acids (C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3) and MDA. The effects of TBHQ and TPP were greater than those of the other antioxidants.ConclusionsThe reduced total FA contents in corn silages were due to unsaturated fatty acids’ oxidation during the early stages of ensiling. Adding an antioxidant could prevent fatty acids’ oxidation in corn silages.',\n",

This also changed the fatty acid profile of omega-6: omega-3 from, 5 to 1 in the CON pork, to a ratio of 1.7 to 1 in DHA pork. The appearance, odor, oxidation rates and sensory taste, as judged by a trained panel, determined the DHA injected meat to be, 'slightly desirable’ and gave lower 'off flavour’ scores, relative to the CON and SF injected pork. Pork can be fortified with DHA oil to 146\\xa0mg/100\\xa0g serving, which would meet half the recommended daily omega 3 fatty acid requirements for adult humans and would be desirable in taste.\",\n",
       " 'BackgroundDuring nutritional stress, reduced intake may reduce the efficacy of anabolic implants. This study was conducted to evaluate basic cellular responses to a growth promotant implant at two intake levels.MethodsSixteen crossbred steers (293\\u2009±\\u200919.3\\xa0kg) were used to evaluate the impact of anabolic implants in either an adequate or a restricted nutritional state. Steers were trained to individual Calan gates, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2\\u2009×\\u20092 factorial arrangement. Treatments consisted of: presence or absence of an anabolic growth implant (Revalor-XS, 200\\xa0mg TBA and 40\\xa0mg estradiol; IMPLANT or CONTROL) and a moderate energy, pelleted, starting cattle diet fed at either 2.0\\u2009×\\u2009or 1.0\\u2009×\\u2009maintenance energy (NEM) requirements (HIGH or LOW). Serum (d 0, 14, and 28) was used for application to bovine muscle satellite cells. After treatment with the serum (20% of total media) from the trial cattle, the satellite cells were incubated for 72\\xa0h. Protein abundance of myosin heavy chain (MHC), phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (phospho-ERK), and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (phospho-mTOR) were analyzed to determine the effects of implant, intake, and their interaction (applied via the serum).ResultsIntake had no effect on MHC (P =\\u20090.85) but IMPLANT increased (P <\\u20090.01) MHC abundance vs. CONTROL. Implant status, intake status, and the interaction had no effect on the abundance of phospho-ERK (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.23). Implanting increased phospho-mTOR (P <\\u20090.01) but there was no effect (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.51) of intake or intake\\u2009×\\u2009implant.ConclusionsThe nearly complete lack of interaction between implant and nutritional status indicates that the signaling molecules measured herein respond to implants and nutritional status independently. Furthermore, results suggest that the muscle hypertrophic effects of anabolic implants may not be mediated by circulating IGF-1.',\n",
       " 'The primary objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of heat treatment on the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) fed to growing pigs. The second objective was to develop regression equations that may be used to predict the concentration of SID AA in corn DDGS. A source of corn DDGS was divided into 4 batches that were either not autoclaved or autoclaved at 130°C for 10, 20, or 30\\xa0min. Four diets containing DDGS from each of the 4 batches were formulated with DDGS being the only source of AA and CP in the diets. A N-free diet also was formulated and used to determine the basal endogenous losses of CP and AA. Ten growing pigs (initial BW: 53.5\\u2009±\\u20093.9\\xa0kg) were surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a replicated 5\\u2009×\\u20094 Youden square design with 5 diets and 4 periods in each square. The SID of CP decreased linearly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) from 77.9% in non-autoclaved DDGS to 72.1, 66.1, and 68.5% in the DDGS samples that were autoclaved for 10, 20, or 30\\xa0min, respectively. The SID of lysine was quadratically reduced (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) from 66.8% in the non-autoclaved DDGS to 54.9, 55.3, and 51.9% in the DDGS autoclaved for 10, 20, or 30\\xa0min, respectively. The concentrations of SID Arginine, Histidine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, or Threonine may be best predicted by equations that include the concentration of acid detergent insoluble N in the model (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.76, 0.68, 0.67, 0.84, 0.76, 0.73, or 0.54, respectively). The concentrations of SID Isoleucine and Valine were predicted (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.58 and 0.54, respectively) by the Lysine:CP ratio, whereas the concentration of SID Tryptophan was predicted (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.70) by the analyzed concentration of Tryptophan in DDGS. In conclusion, the SID of AA is decreased as a result of heat damage and the concentration of SID AA in heat-damaged DDGS may be predicted by regression equations developed in this experiment.',\n",
       " 'Modern pig production contributes to many environmental problems that relate to manure, especially in areas with highly intensive production systems and in regions like Asia where the regulative control is not effective. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use three different pig diets varying in dietary protein, fibre and fat as representative for Danish (DK), Thai (TH) and Vietnamese (VN) pig production to develop and evaluate different approaches to predict/calculate excretion from growing pigs in comparison with the experimentally determined values.Nine female growing pigs were used in a digestibility and balance experiment. Excretion of dry matter (DM), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) of the experimental diets were determined.Due to the highest dietary fibre content, VN had the lowest digestibility of N, P and C (73, 49, and 73%, respectively) compared with the DK and TH pig diets. From the known diet composition using standard table values on chemical and nutrient digestibly, high accuracy (bias) and low variation was found and the results could be used for prediction on chemical composition and excretion in faeces and urine in growing pigs. Calculation based on standard values regarding nutrient retention in the pig body as used in the Danish manure normative system (DMNS) showed likewise to be quite useful for quantifying the total excretion of N and P.Overall, the results demonstrate that simple models that require cheap and normally available information on dietary nutrients can give useful information on nutrient excretion in growing pigs.',\n",

The quantity of fat deposited increases faster and earlier in the fast-growing chickens than in slow-growing chickens. In this study, Affymetrix Genechip® Chicken Genome Arrays 32773 transcripts were used to compare gene expression profiles in liver and hypothalamus tissues of fast-growing and slow-growing chicken at 8 wk of age. Real-time RT-PCR was used to validate the differential expression of genes selected from the microarray analysis. The mRNA expression of the genes was further examined in fat tissues. The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of four lipid-related genes with fat traits was examined in a F2 resource population.ResultsFour hundred genes in the liver tissues and 220 genes hypothalamus tissues, respectively, were identified to be differentially expressed in fast-growing chickens and slow-growing chickens. Expression levels of genes for lipid metabolism (SULT1B1, ACSBG2, PNPLA3, LPL, AOAH) carbohydrate metabolism (MGAT4B, XYLB, GBE1, PGM1, HKDC1) cholesttrol biosynthesis (FDPS, LSS, HMGCR, NSDHL, DHCR24, IDI1, ME1) HSD17B7 and other reaction or processes (CYP1A4, CYP1A1, AKR1B1, CYP4V2, DDO) were higher in the fast-growing White Recessive Rock chickens than in the slow-growing Xinghua chickens. On the other hand, expression levels of genes associated with multicellular organism development, immune response, DNA integration, melanin biosynthetic process, muscle organ development and oxidation-reduction (FRZB, DMD, FUT8, CYP2C45, DHRSX, and CYP2C18) and with glycol-metabolism (GCNT2, ELOVL 6, and FASN), were higher in the XH chickens than in the fast-growing chickens. RT-PCR validated high expression levels of nine out of 12 genes in fat tissues. The G1257069A and T1247123C of the ACSBG2 gene were significantly associated with abdominal fat weight. The G4928024A of the FASN gene were significantly associated with fat bandwidth, and abdominal fat percentage. The C4930169T of the FASN gene was associated with abdominal fat weight while the A59539099G of the ELOVL 6 was significantly associated with subcutaneous fat. The A8378815G of the DDT was associated with fat band width.ConclusionThe differences in fat deposition were reflected with differential gene expressions in fast and slow growing chickens.',\n",

However, additional research is needed to identify optimal culture conditions and to determine the mechanisms involved in regulating BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts. The objectives of the experiments were to determine: 1) if autologous or commercial serum is better for proliferation and differentiation of equine BMSC into osteoblasts, and 2) the expression of key transcription factors during the differentiation of equine BMSC into osteoblasts. Equine BMSC were isolated from the sterna of 3 horses, treated with purchased fetal bovine serum (FBS) or autologous horse serum (HS), and cell proliferation determined. To induce osteoblast differentiation, cells were incubated with L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate and glycerol-2-phosphate in the presence or absence of human bone morphogenetic protein2 (BMP2), dexamethasone (DEX), or combination of the two. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a marker of osteoblast differentiation, was determined by ELISA. Total RNA was isolated from differentiating BMSC between d 0 to 18 to determine expression of runt-related transcription factor2 (Runx2), osterix (Osx), and T-box3 (Tbx3). Data were analyzed by ANOVA.ResultsRelative to control, FBS and HS increased cell number (133\\u2009±\\u20095 and 116\\u2009±\\u20095%, respectively; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (167\\u2009±\\u20096 and 120\\u2009±\\u20096%, respectively; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Treatment with DEX increased ALP activity compared with control (1,638\\u2009±\\u200938%; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In the absence and presence of Dex, BMP-2 did not alter ALP activity (P\\u2009>\\u20090.8). Runt-related transcription factor2 expression increased 3-fold (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) by d 6 of culture. Osterix expression increased 9-fold (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) by d 18 of culture.

In order to better understand the endometrium involved mechanisms of implantation, we used LC-MS/MS technique to profile the proteome of ovine endometrial C areas and IC areas separately during the peri-implantation period, and then compared the proteomic profiles between these two areas. We successfully detected 1740 and 1813 proteins in C areas and IC areas respectively.

The results could help us to better understand the implantation in the ewes. In addition, we established a relatively detailed protein database of ovine endometrium, which provide a unique reference for further studies.',\n",
       " 'In 2012, genetically engineered (GE) crops were grown by 17.3 million farmers on over 170 million hectares. Over 70% of harvested GE biomass is fed to food producing animals, making them the major consumers of GE crops for the past 15 plus years. Prior to commercialization, GE crops go through an extensive regulatory evaluation. Over one hundred regulatory submissions have shown compositional equivalence, and comparable levels of safety, between GE crops and their conventional counterparts. One component of regulatory compliance is whole GE food/feed animal feeding studies. Both regulatory studies and independent peer-reviewed studies have shown that GE crops can be safely used in animal feed, and rDNA fragments have never been detected in products (e.g. milk, meat, eggs) derived from animals that consumed GE feed. Despite the fact that the scientific weight of evidence from these hundreds of studies have not revealed unique risks associated with GE feed, some groups are calling for more animal feeding studies, including long-term rodent studies and studies in target livestock species for the approval of GE crops. It is an opportune time to review the results of such studies as have been done to date to evaluate the value of the additional information obtained. Requiring long-term and target animal feeding studies would sharply increase regulatory compliance costs and prolong the regulatory process associated with the commercialization of GE crops. Such costs may impede the development of feed crops with enhanced nutritional characteristics and durability, particularly in the local varieties in small and poor developing countries. More generally it is time for regulatory evaluations to more explicitly consider both the reasonable and unique risks and benefits associated with the use of both GE plants and animals in agricultural systems, and weigh them against those associated with existing systems, and those of regulatory inaction. This would represent a shift away from a GE evaluation process that currently focuses only on risk assessment and identifying ever diminishing marginal hazards, to a regulatory approach that more objectively evaluates and communicates the likely impact of approving a new GE plant or animal on agricultural production systems.',\n",

DDGS were analyzed for their metabolizable energy (ME) contents, measured for color score and chemical composition (crude protein, crude fat, ash, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber), to predict the equation of ME in DDGS. A precision-fed rooster assay was used, each DDGS sample was tube fed (50\\xa0g) to adult roosters. The experiment was conducted as a randomized incomplete block design with 3 periods. Ninety-five adult roosters were used in each period, with 90 being fed the DDGS samples and 5 being fasted to estimate basal endogenous energy losses.ResultsResults showed that the AME ranged from 5.93 to 12.19\\xa0MJ/kg, TME ranged from 7.28 to 13.54\\xa0MJ/kg.

       " 'BackgroundMany studies have investigated endogenous loss of proteins and amino acids (AAs) at the ileal level in growing pigs. However, only a few studies have researched this subject in piglets. Knowledge regarding AA ileal digestibility in piglets would be helpful during the formulation of diets for weaning piglets, rather than just using coefficients obtained in growing pigs. Therefore, in this study, we sought to estimate endogenous protein and AA ileal losses in piglets. Furthermore, apparent and true ileal digestibility (AID and TID) of protein and AAs from casein were measured.ResultsThe average flow of protein was 20.8\\xa0g/kg of dry matter intake (DMI). Basal protein loss, as estimated by regression, was 16.9\\xa0g/kg DMI. Glutamic acid, arginine, and aspartic acid (2.2, 1.4, and 1.2\\xa0g/kg DMI, respectively) were the AAs for which greater losses were seen. The AID of protein and AAs increased as the protein level in the diet increased. A higher increment in AID was observed between diets with 80 and160 g CP/kg of feed; this finding was mainly attributable to increases in glycine and arginine (46.1% and 18%, respectively). The TID of protein was 97.8, and the TID of AAs varied from 93.9 for histidine to 100.2 for phenylalanine.ConclusionsThe basal endogenous protein loss in piglets was 16.9\\xa0g/kg DMI. Endogenous protein was rich in glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and arginine, which represented 32.7% of endogenous protein loss in weaning piglets. The TID of casein was high and varied from 93.0 for histidine to 100.2 for phenylalanine.',\n",

The potential of antimicrobial peptides, clay minerals, egg yolk antibodies, essential oils, eucalyptus oil-medium chain fatty acids, rare earth elements and recombinant enzymes are discussed. Based on a thorough review of the literature, it is evident that a long and growing list of compounds exist which have been tested for their ability to replace antibiotics as feed additives in diets fed to swine.

The results showed that feed intake, egg production, and average egg weights were quadratically correlated with dietary nonphytate phosphorus content (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and the highest egg production, feed intake and average egg weights were achieved when dietary nonphytate phosphorus was at 0.3% (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). mRNA expression of intestinal sodium phosphorus co-transporter linearly decreased when dietary nonphytate phosphorus increased. mRNA and protein expression of intestinal calbindin and vitamin D receptor correlated quadratically with dietary nonphytate phosphorus, and the highest expression was found when dietary available phosphorus was at 0.25% to 0.3%. In conclusion, the ideal phosphorus requirement for Dwarf pink-shell layer hens is estimated to be 0.3% in a corn-soybean diet. With this level of phosphorus supplementation, calbindin and vitamin D receptor reached their highest expression.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundPlay behavior has been proposed as a new potential indicator of animal welfare. Animals play only if they are in a relaxed state. Play may improve adaptability to challenging environments which may be of interest in the breeding objective. Little information is available on play behavior in livestock species. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether play behavior in post-weaned piglets can be induced instantly in the presence of additional space and whether play markers are body weight, sex, and litter dependent. It is investigated whether playfulness is elicited by the moment or if this measure is consistent over different days.MethodsThirty two piglets from four litters were released into a corridor and video recorded for eight min at 37, 41, 44 and 48 d of age. The first test was considered as an adjustment period and was not included in the analysis. In the second to the fourth test, joyful brusque movements (jumping, turning and running) were recorded with a camera and total number of movements (JOY#) and total time (JOYtime) were estimated individually. Animals were weighed at 41 d of age.ResultsFemales had higher scores of JOY# and JOYtime than males but this was significant only for JOY# at 41 d of age (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The effect of age was highly significant both for JOY# and JOYtime (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Animals with a higher JOY# and JOYtime also expressed a higher JOY# and JOYtime in the other tests, but this was significant only between 44 and 48 d of age (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Body weight at 41 d of age was not significantly related to JOY# and JOYtime in any of the tests.ConclusionsLocomotor play was induced instantly by the provision of increased space allowance.

       " 'The availability of local feed resources in various seasons can contribute as essential sources of carbohydrate and protein which significantly impact rumen fermentation and the subsequent productivity of the ruminant. Recent developments, based on enriching protein in cassava chips, have yielded yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) providing up to 47.5% crude protein (CP), which can be used to replace soybean meal. The use of fodder trees has been developed through the process of pelleting; Leucaena leucocephala leaf pellets (LLP), mulberry leaf pellets (MUP) and mangosteen peel and/or garlic pellets, can be used as good sources of protein to supplement ruminant feeding. Apart from producing volatile fatty acids and microbial proteins, greenhouse gases such as methane are also produced in the rumen. Several methods have been used to reduce rumen methane. However, among many approaches, nutritional manipulation using feed formulation and feeding management, especially the use of plant extracts or plants containing secondary compounds (condensed tannins and saponins) and plant oils, has been reported. This approach could help todecrease rumen protozoa and methanogens and thus mitigate the production of methane. At present, more research concerning this burning issue - the role of livestock in global warming - warrants undertaking further research with regard to economic viability and practical feasibility.',\n",
       " 'The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the variation of nutrient digestion, plasma metabolites and oxidative stress parameters triggered by induced subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA); and 2) evaluate the ability of pelleted beet pulp (BP) as a replacement for ground corn to alleviate SARA. Eight Holstein-Friesian cows were fed four diets during four successive17-day periods: 1) total mixed ration (TMR) containing 0% finely ground wheat (FGW) (W0); 2) TMR containing 10% FGW (W10); 3) TMR containing 20% FGW (W20); and 4) TMR containing 10% BP as a replacement for 10% ground corn (BP10). The SARA induction protocol reduced the mean ruminal pH from 6.37 to 5.94, and the minimum ruminal pH decreased from 5.99 to 5.41 from baseline to challenge period. Mean ruminal pH increased from 5.94 to 6.05, and minimum daily ruminal pH increased from 5.41 to 5.63, when BP was substituted for corn. The apparent digestibility of nutrients was not affected by the dietary treatments, except that the digestibility of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) was reduced in cows fed the W20 diet compared with cows fed the W0 and W10 diets, and cows fed the BP10 diet had higher NDF and ADF digestibility than the cows fed the W20 diet. Cows fed the W20 diet had a lower plasma concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), cholesterol, triglyceride, and total antioxidative capacity (TAC), and a higher plasma concentration of glucose, insulin, malonaldehyde (MDA), super oxygen dehydrogenises (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) than cows fed the W0 diet. Substitution of BP for corn increased concentrations of plasma BHBA and TAC, but decreased concentrations of plasma MDA. Our results indicate that reduction of fibre digestion; the concomitant increase of plasma glucose and insulin; the decrease of plasma BHBA, NEFA, cholesterol, and triglyceride; and changes of plasma oxidative stress parameters are highly related to SARA induced by W20 diets. These variables may be alternative candidates for SARA diagnosis. We also suggest that the substitution of BP for corn could reduce the risk of SARA, increase fibre digestion, and improve the antioxidant status in dairy cows.',\n",
       " 'A novel method for haplotype phasing in families after joint estimation of recombination fraction and linkage disequilibrium is developed. Results from Monte Carlo computer simulations show that the newly developed E.M. algorithm is accurate if true recombination fraction is 0 even for single families of relatively small sizes. Estimates of recombination fraction and linkage disequilibrium were 0.00 (SD 0.00) and 0.19 (SD 0.03) for simulated recombination fraction and linkage disequilibrium of 0.00 and 0.20, respectively. A genome fragmentation phasing strategy was developed and used for phasing haplotypes in a sire and 36 progeny using the 50 k Illumina BeadChip by: a) estimation of the recombination fraction and LD in consecutive SNPs using family information, b) linkage analyses between fragments, c) phasing of haplotypes in parents and progeny and in following generations. Homozygous SNPs in progeny allowed determination of paternal fragment inheritance, and deduction of SNP sequence information of haplotypes from dams. The strategy also allowed detection of genotyping errors. A total of 613 recombination events were detected after linkage analysis was carried out between fragments. Hot and cold spots were identified at the individual (sire level). SNPs for which the sire and calf were heterozygotes became informative (over 90%) after the phasing of haplotypes. Average of regions of identity between half-sibs when comparing its maternal inherited haplotypes (with at least 20 SNP) in common was 0.11 with a maximum of 0.29 and a minimum of 0.05. A Monte-Carlo simulation of BTA1 with the same linkage disequilibrium structure and genetic linkage as the cattle family yielded a 99.98 and 99.94% of correct phases for informative SNPs in sire and calves, respectively.',\n",

Glutamine was added at 1% in all three post-weaning diet phases and AG was added at .88% in phase 1 and 2 and at .66% in phase 3.ResultsFeed conversion (feed/gain) showed means among treatment means close to significance (P\\u2009=\\u20090.056) and Tukey’s test for pairwise mean comparisons showed that Pigs in the CFGLN-GLN group had the best feed conversion (feed/gain) in the first three-week period post-weaning, exceeding (P\\u2009=\\u20090.044) controls (CFCD-CD) by 34%. The NC-AG group had (P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) the greatest feed intake in the last three week of the study, exceeding controls (CFCD-CD) by 12%. CFGLN-GLN, CFCD-GLN and sow reared (SR) pigs had the greatest (P\\u2009=\\u20090.049) villi height exceeding the CFCD-AG group by 18%, 20% and 19% respectively. The CFAG-AG group had the deepest (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) crypts among all treatments. CFGLN-GLN, CFCD-GLN and SR groups had the greatest (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) number of cells proliferating (PCNA) exceeding those in the NC-CD group by 43%, 54% and 63% respectively. Sow reared pigs showed the greatest (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) intestinal absorption capacity for xylose and mannitol.ConclusionSupplementation of creep feed and nursery diets with GLN and/or AminoGut in the first three week improved feed conversion possibly due to improved intestinal health.',\n",
       " 'In this study, we sought to investigate the expression of the transcription factor E2F1 in chicken pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells upon hypoxia exposure, as well as the role that E2F1 played in the regulation of cell proliferation. Isolated chicken pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells were subjected to hypoxia or normoxia for indicated time points. Cell viability, DNA synthesis, cell cycle profile, and expression of E2F1 were analyzed. The results showed that hypoxia promoted cell proliferation and DNA synthesis which was accompanied by an increased S phase entry and upregulation of E2F1 at mRNA and protein levels. Using siRNA technology, we demonstrated that gene inactivation of endogenous E2F1 abolished hypoxia-induced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and S phase entry compared with negative siRNA transfected cells. These results suggest that hypoxia-induced proliferation is mediated by inducing E2F1 in chicken pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.',\n",
       " 'The intestine and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are essential components of whole body immune defense, protecting the body from foreign antigens and pathogens, while allowing tolerance to commensal bacteria and dietary antigens. The requirement for protein to support the immune system is well established. Less is known regarding the immune modifying properties of individual amino acids, particularly on the GALT. Both oral and parenteral feeding studies have established convincing evidence that not only the total protein intake, but the availability of specific dietary amino acids (in particular glutamine, glutamate, and arginine, and perhaps methionine, cysteine and threonine) are essential to optimizing the immune functions of the intestine and the proximal resident immune cells. These amino acids each have unique properties that include, maintaining the integrity, growth and function of the intestine, as well as normalizing inflammatory cytokine secretion and improving T-lymphocyte numbers, specific T cell functions, and the secretion of IgA by lamina propria cells. Our understanding of this area has come from studies that have supplemented single amino acids to a mixed protein diet and measuring the effect on specific immune parameters. Future studies should be designed using amino acid mixtures that target a number of specific functions of GALT in order to optimize immune function in domestic animals and humans during critical periods of development and various disease states.',\n",
       " 'This reviews research focused to understand the nutrient requirement and balance to meet the needs of fetal growth, mammary growth, and milk production. This summary will handle how feeding strategies can be adjusted according to the nutrient needs for a sow to enhance productivity and health. Most research data used in this summary are based on the studies conducted by the authors between 1996 and 2013. Nutrient requirements of sows are affected by stage of gestation and parity of sows. Dietary antioxidant concentrations need to be re-evaluated for its sufficiency in sow diets especially to prevent excessive oxidative stress during late gestation and lactation. When feeding sows, consideration of phase feeding of gestating sows and parity feeding of lactating sows could enhances production longevity and health of sows. Use of selected nutrients and additives seems to help productivity and health of sows.',\n",
       " 'Humans and animals are in regular and at times close contact in modern intensive farming systems. The quality of human-animal interactions can have a profound impact on the productivity and welfare of farm animals. Interactions by humans may be neutral, positive or negative in nature. Regular pleasant contact with humans may result in desirable alterations in the physiology, behaviour, health and productivity of farm animals. On the contrary, animals that were subjected to aversive human contact were highly fearful of humans and their growth and reproductive performance could be compromised. Farm animals are particularly sensitive to human stimulation that occurs early in life, while many systems of the animals are still developing. This may have long-lasting impact and could possibly modify their genetic potential. The question as to how human contact can have a positive impact on responses to stressors, and productivity is not well understood. Recent work in our laboratory suggested that pleasant human contact may alter ability to tolerate various stressors through enhanced heat shock protein (hsp) 70 expression. The induction of hsp is often associated with increased tolerance to environmental stressors and disease resistance in animals. The attitude and consequent behaviour of stockpeople affect the animals’ fear of human which eventually influence animals’ productivity and welfare. Other than attitude and behaviour, technical skills, knowledge, job motivation, commitment and job satisfaction are prerequisites for high job performance.',\n",
       " 'Maternal recognition of pregnancy refers to the requirement for the conceptus (embryo and its associated extra-embryonic membranes) to produce a hormone that acts on the uterus and/or corpus luteum (CL) to ensure maintenance of a functional CL for production of progesterone; the hormone required for pregnancy in most mammals. The pregnancy recognition signal in primates is chorionic gonadotrophin which acts directly on the CL via luteinizing hormone receptors to ensure maintenance of functional CL during pregnancy. In ruminants, interferon tau (IFNT) is the pregnancy recognition signal. IFNT is secreted during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy and acts on uterine epithelia to silence expression of estrogen receptor alpha and oxytocin receptor which abrogates the oxytocin-dependent release of luteolytic pulses of prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF) by uterine epithelia; therefore, the CL continues to produce progesterone required for pregnancy. Pig conceptuses secrete interferon delta and interferon gamma during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy, but there is no evidence that they are involved in pregnancy recognition signaling. Rather, pig conceptuses secrete abundant amounts of estrogens between Days 11 to 15 of pregnancy required for maternal recognition of pregnancy. Estrogen, likely in concert with prolactin, prevents secretion of PGF into the uterine venous drainage (endocrine secretion), but maintains secretion of PGF into the uterine lumen (exocrine secretion) where it is metabolized to a form that is not luteolytic. Since PGF is sequestered within the uterine lumen and unavailable to induce luteolysis, functional CL are maintained for production of progesterone. In addition to effects of chorionic gonadotrophin, IFNT and estrogens to signal pregnancy recognition, these hormones act on uterine epithelia to enhance expression of genes critical for growth and development of the conceptus.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIn mammals, leptin is an attractive candidate for mediating the metabolic signal and the reproductive function via the specific receptor in hypothalamus. However, till now, the role of leptin on reproduction in birds is less well established. This experiment was conducted to elucidate the role of leptin on the onset of reproduction in bird, as a first step, to detect the changes of peripheral leptin and leptin receptor mRNA expression in hypothalamus between mature and immature hens at the same age. 120 ISA brown pullets at D60 were allocated randomly into two groups, long light (LL) group being raised under artificial light regimes with incrementally increased light phase (from 8\\xa0L:16D to 14\\xa0L:12D) and short light (SL) group raised on consistent light (8\\xa0L:16D) for 12 wk.ResultsThe results showed that pullets in LL group reached sexual maturation 15\\xa0d earlier than those in SL group. Serum E2 showed a significant increase with age, but no difference was observed between two groups. Serum leptin concentration decreased significantly from D112 to D136 in LL, and was markedly higher in LL group than that in SL at D112, while there was no significant difference between two groups at D136. Leptin receptor and GnRH-I mRNA expression in hypothalamus were significantly increased with age, yet there was no significant difference between SL and LL chickens at the same age. The expression of FSH-β and LH-β mRNA in pituitary was increased with age but did not show significant difference between LL and SL group. GnRH-I mRNA expression was very rich in pineal gland, and decreased from D112 to D136 in LL but not in SL group, and there was no difference between two groups at the same age.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the earlier sexual maturation in hens induced by long-light regime is not accompanied with an increase in serum leptin or leptin receptor gene expression in hypothalamus, or genes expression in HPG axis.',\n",

       " 'BackgroundIncreasing the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and decreasing the saturated fatty acid (SFA) content of mutton can help to improve its nutritional value for consumers. Several laboratories have evaluated the effects of vitamin E on the fatty acid (FA) composition of muscle in sheep. However, little information is available on wool sheep, even though wool sheep breeds are an important source of mutton, especially in northern China where sheep are extensively farmed. The present study was designed to address the effects of vitamin E on muscle FA composition in male Aohan fine-wool sheep.MethodsForty-two male Aohan fine-wool lambs (5 mo old) with similar initial body weight were randomly divided into seven groups and fed diets supplemented with 0 (control group), 20, 100, 200, 1,000, 2,000, or 2,400 IU/sheep/d vitamin E for 12 mo. Three lambs from each group were slaughtered to measure vitamin E and FA content in the longissimus lumborum (LL) and gluteus medius (GM) muscles.ResultsVitamin E concentrations in the LL and GM increased significantly after 12 mo of vitamin E supplementation (P < 0.05). However, this increase did not occur in a dose-dependent manner because the muscle vitamin E concentration was highest in the 200 IU/sheep/d group. Dietary vitamin E supplementation also caused a significant reduction in SFA content and an increase in monounsaturated FA (MUFA) content in the LL and GM (P < 0.05). All six doses of vitamin E significantly increased cis 9 trans 11-conjugated linoleic acid (c 9t 11-CLA) content in the LL compared with the control group (P < 0.05).ConclusionsDietary supplementation with vitamin E increased muscle vitamin E content and improved the nutritional value of mutton by decreasing SFA content and increasing MUFA and c 9t 11-CLA contents in Aohan fine-wool sheep. These effects were greatest in sheep fed a diet containing 200 IU/sheep/d vitamin E.',\n",

       " 'Pigs experience biological stress such as physiological, environmental, and social challenges when weaned from the sow. The process of weaning is one of the most stressful events in the pig’s life that can contribute to intestinal and immune system dysfunctions that result in reduced pig health, growth, and feed intake, particularly during the first week after weaning. Technological improvements in housing, nutrition, health, and management have been used to minimize some of the adverse effects of weaning stress, but a greater understanding of the biological impact of stress is needed to improve strategies to overcome weaning stress. The focus of this review paper is to briefly describe how the biological stress associated with weaning impacts intestinal morphology, structure, physiology, and intestinal immune responses that can impact subsequent production efficiencies such as growth, intake, morbidity, and mortality.',\n",

This experiment was conducted to determine the effects of fractionation of wheat DDGS on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and performance when fed to broiler chicks (0–21 d).MethodsA total of 150, day-old, male broiler chicks (Ross-308 line; Lilydale Hatchery, Wynyard, Saskatchewan) weighing an average of 49.6 ± 0.8 g were assigned to one of five dietary treatments in a completely randomized design. The control diet was based on wheat and soybean meal and contained 20% regular wheat DDGS. The experimental diets contained 5, 10, 15 or 20% fractionated wheat DDGS added at the expense of regular wheat DDGS.ResultsThe ATTD of dry matter and gross energy were linearly increased (P < 0.01) as the level of fractionated wheat DDGS in the diet increased. Nitrogen retention was unaffected by level of fractionated wheat DDGS (P > 0.05). Weight gain increased linearly (P = 0.05) as the level of fractionated wheat DDGS in the diet increased. Feed intake, feed conversion and mortality were unaffected by level of fractionated wheat DDGS in the diet (P > 0.05).ConclusionsPost-production fractionation of wheat DDGS improves their nutritional value by lowering their fiber content and increasing their content of crude protein and energy. These changes in chemical composition supported increased weight gain of broilers fed wheat DDGS.',\n",

       " 'Arginine (ARG) exerts many beneficial effects on animal body and enhanced angiogenesis, lactogenesis, which finally leads to the improvement in nitrogen (N) metabolism, reproduction, lactation, immunity and growth. Unfortunately, unprotected ARG will be degraded in the rumen and its price is high, thus feeding rumen-protected ARG seems to be uneconomical. Alternatively, N-carbamoyl glutamate (NCG) is structural analogue of N-acetyl glutamate, cofactor of cabamoyl phosphate synthetase1, is lower in rumen degradation compared to ARG. Additionally, rumen epithelial and duodenal cells have potentially utilized the NCG for ureagenesis. Supplementation of NCG to high yielding dairy cows increased plasma concentration of ARG and nitric oxide, decreased the plasma ammonia N and improved lactation performance and N utilization. Supplementation of NCG enhanced pregnancy rates in rats, improved litter size and fetal survival rate, thereby improved the reproductive performance of sows. Oral NCG supplementation increases plasma ARG and somatotropin levels, and increased growth rate and muscle protein synthesis in nursing piglets. The NCG is potential a relatively cheaper source of feed additive to offer vital compensation over oral administration of ARG, resulting in improved ruminant animal health and production. In this article, we reviewed the mechanism of ARG biosynthesis by NCG and their significance in growth, reproduction, milk production and N utilization in ruminant animals.',\n",

A 2\\u2009×\\u20094 factorial design was used with two basal diets (the positive control group, PC; negative control with ME reduction 100\\xa0kcal/kg, NC) and with or without the addition of three exogenous enzymes (0.02% BM; 0.01% AG; 0.05% XG) respectively. 1,200 one-day-old broilers were randomly allocated to 8 treatments with 10 pens of 15 broilers. There was no significant difference on BW, BWG, and FI at 0-21d, 21-42d or 0-42d for diet, enzymes or their interactions, but FI at 22-42d and 0-42d were tend to be decreased with the addition of enzymes. The F/G was significantly improved by the addition of enzymes especially in NC diet. The dietary AME and TME in PC or NC diet were significantly increased by XG or AG in NC diet. The villus length and V/C of ileum were significantly increased by the addition of BM or XG. XG improved the activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin and amylase, BM improved the activity of trypsin at 21d, and AG improved the activity of chymotrypsin at 21d. Comparing to PC diet, the addition of enzymes in PC or NC diet decreased feed cost per kg body weight gain especially in NC diet (except AG in PC diet) with the highest profits for XG in NC diet. In conclusion, supplementation of 0.02% BM or 0.01% AG or 0.05% XG could improve feed conversion of broilers in corn-soybean meal diet by improving energy utilization and digestive physiology, and also supplementation of 0.05% XG had a preferable efficacy in low energy diet.',\n",

The unique intra-chromosomal recombination pattern of Y chromosome and morphological difference of this chromosome between Bos taurus and Bos indicus make it an ideal model for studying structural variation, especially in crossbred (Bos taurus\\u2009×\\u2009Bos indicus) bulls. Copy Number Variation (CNV) is a type of genomic structural variation that gives information complementary to SNP data. The purpose of this study was to find out copy number differences of four Y chromosomal spermatogenesis-related candidate genes in genomic DNA of crossbred and purebred Indicine bulls.ResultFour Y chromosomal candidate genes of spermatogenesis namely, sex determining gene on Y chromosome (SRY), DEAD box polypeptide 3-Y chromosome (DDX3Y), Ubiquitin specific peptidase 9, Y-linked (USP9Y), testis-specific protein on Y chromosome (TSPY) were evaluated. Absolute copy numbers of Y chromosomal genes were determined by standard curve-based quantitative real time PCR. Copy numbers of SRY and TSPY genes per unit amount of genomic DNA are higher in crossbred than Indicine bulls. However, no difference was observed in DDX3Y and USP9Y gene copy numbers between two groups.ConclusionThe present study demonstrates that the structural organization of Y chromosomes differs between crossbred and Indicine bulls which are reproductively healthy as observed from analysis of semen attributes. The absolute copy numbers of SRY and TSPY genes in unit mass of genomic DNA of crossbred bulls are significantly higher than Indicine bulls. No alteration in absolute copies of DDX3Y and USP9Y gene was found between the genome of crossbred and Indicine bulls. This study suggests that the DDX3Y and USP9Y are likely to be single copy genes in the genome of crossbred and Indicine bulls and variation in Y chromosome length between crossbred and Indicine bulls may be due to the copy number variation of SRY gene and TSPY array.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is essential for mitosis and plays an important role in the regulation of microtubule assembly during oocyte meiotic maturation in mice; however, little is known about its role in porcine oocytes.ResultTotal p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and phosphorylated PAK1 at Thr423 (PAK1Thr423) were consistently expressed in porcine oocytes from the germinal vesicle (GV) to the second metaphase (MII) stages, but phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (H3Ser10) was only expressed after the GV stage. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PAK1Thr423 and H3Ser10 colocalized on chromosomes after the GV stage. Blocking of endogenous PAK1Thr423 by injecting a specific antibody decreased the phosphorylation level of H3Ser10; however, it had no impact on chromatin condensation, meiotic progression, cleavage rate of blastomeres or the rate of blastocyst formation.ConclusionPhosphorylation of PAK1Thr423 is a spontaneous activation process and the activated PAK1Thr423 can promote the phosphorylation of H3Ser10; however, this pathway is not required for meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes or early embryonic development.',\n",

After successful isolation of embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, there are many methods for producing chimeras, including co-culture with the embryos, microinjection of the ES cells into pre-implantation embryos, and use of tetraploid embryos to generate the full ES-derived transgenic mice. Here, we aimed to generate the transgenic ES cell line, compare the production efficiency of chimeric mice and its proportion to yield the male chimeric mice by microinjected ES cells into 4- to 8-cell and blastocysts embryos with the application of Piezo-Micromanipulator (PMM), and trace the fate of the injected ES cells.ResultsWe successfully generated a transgenic ES cell line and proved that this cell line still maintained pluripotency. Although we achieved a satisfactory chimeric mice rate, there was no significant difference in the production of chimeric mice using the two different methods, but the proportion of the male chimeric mice in the 4- to 8-cell group was higher than in the blastocyst group. We also found that there was no tendency for ES cells to aggregate into the inner cell mass using in vitro culture of the chimeric embryos, indicating that they aggregated randomly.ConclusionsThese results showed that the PMM method is a convenient way to generate chimeric mice and microinjection of ES cells into 4- to 8-cell embryos can increase the chance of yielding male chimeras compared to the blastocyst injection. These results provide useful data in transgenic research mediated by ES cells.',\n",

       " 'Application of feed processing methods and use of exogenous feed additives in an effort to improve nutrient digestibility of plant-based feed ingredients for swine has been studied for decades. The following review will discuss several of these topics, including: fiber characterization, impact of dietary fiber on gastrointestinal physiology, energy, and nutrient digestibility, mechanical processing of feed on fiber and energy digestibility, and the use of exogenous enzymes in diets fed to growing pigs. Taken together, the diversity and concentration of chemical characteristics that exists among plant-based feed ingredients, as well as interactions among constituents within feed ingredients and diets, suggests that improvements in nutrient digestibility and pig performance from mechanical processing or adding exogenous enzymes to diets fed to swine depends on a better understanding of these characteristics, but also relating enzyme activity to targeted substrates. It may be that an enzyme must not only match a target substrate(s), but there may also need to be a ′cocktail′ of enzymes to effectively breakdown the complex matrixes of fibrous carbohydrates, such that the negative impact of these compounds on nutrient digestibility or voluntary feed intake are alleviated. With the inverse relationship between fiber content and energy digestibility being well described for several feed ingredients, it is only logical that development of processing techniques or enzymes that degrade fiber, and thereby improve energy digestibility or voluntary feed intake, will be both metabolically and economically beneficial to pork production.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the origin and evolution of Chinese pigs using complete mitochondrial genomic sequences (mtDNA) from Asian and European domestic pigs and wild boars. Thirty primer pairs were designed to determine the mtDNA sequences of Xiang pig, Large White, Lantang, Jinhua and Pietrain. The phylogenetic status of Chinese native pigs was investigated by comparing the mtDNA sequences of complete coding regions and D-loop regions respectively amongst Asian breeds, European breeds and wild boars. The analyzed results by two cluster methods contributed to the same conclusion that all pigs were classified into two major groups, European clade and Asian clade. It revealed that Chinese pigs were only recently diverged from each other and distinctly different from European pigs. Berkshire was clustered with Asian pigs and Chinese pigs were involved in the development of Berkshire breeding. The Malaysian wild boar had distant genetic relationship with European and Asian pigs. Jinhua and Lanyu pigs had more nucleotide diversity with Chinese pigs although they all belonged to the Asian major clade.

The breakpoint for the ATTD of phosphorus (69.1%) was reached at a phytase inclusion level of 801 FYT/kg. In conclusion, the novel bacterial 6-phytase improved the ATTD of phosphorus and calcium in both weanling and growing pigs. The optimum level of inclusion for this phytase is 800 to 1,000 FYT/kg of complete feed to maximize ATTD of phosphorus and calcium in weanling and growing pigs.',\n",
       " 'Protein is quantitatively the most expensive nutrient in swine diets. Hence it is imperative to understand the physiological roles played by amino acids in growth, development, lactation, reproduction, and health of pigs to improve their protein nutrition and reduce the costs of pork production. Due to incomplete knowledge of amino acid biochemistry and nutrition, it was traditionally assumed that neonatal, post-weaning, growing-finishing, and gestating pigs could synthesize sufficient amounts of all \"nutritionally nonessential amino acids\" (NEAA) to support maximum production performance. Therefore, over the past 50\\u2009years, much emphasis has been placed on dietary requirements of nutritionally essential amino acids as building blocks for tissue proteins. However, a large body of literature shows that NEAA, particularly glutamine, glutamate, arginine and proline regulate physiological functions via cell signaling pathways, such as mammalian target of rapamycin, AMP-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-related kinase, Jun kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and NEAA-derived gaseous molecules (e.g., nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide). Available evidence shows that under current feeding programs, only 70% and 55% of dietary amino acids are deposited as tissue proteins in 14-day-old sow-reared piglets and in 30-day-old pigs weaned at 21\\u2009days of age, respectively. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the roles and dietary requirements of NEAA in swine nutrition. This review highlights the basic biochemistry and physiology of absorption and utilization of amino acids in young pigs to enhance the efficacy of utilization of dietary protein and to minimize excretion of nitrogenous wastes from the body.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundObjectives were to examine the effects of selenium (Se) supply and maternal nutritional plane during gestation on mammary gland growth, cellular proliferation, and vascularity at parturition and d 20 of lactation. Rambouillet primiparous ewes (n\\u2009=\\u200984) were allocated to treatments in a 2 x 3 factorial. Factors were dietary Se (adequate Se [ASe, 11.5\\xa0μg/kg BW] or high Se [HSe, 77.0\\xa0μg/kg BW]) and nutritional plane (60% [RES], 100% [CON], or 140% [EXC]). At parturition, lambs were removed and 42 ewes (7/treatment) were necropsied. Remaining ewes were fed a common diet meeting requirements for lactation and mechanically milked twice daily until necropsy on d 20. At both necropsy periods, mammary glands were dissected and tissues harvested. Samples were analyzed for RNA, DNA, and protein content, cell proliferation, and vascularity. Where interactions were present (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05), least squares means from the highest-order interaction are presented.ResultsFinal body weight of ewes was least (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.002) in RES, intermediate for CON, and greatest for EXC, regardless of stage of the ewe at necropsy (parturition or d 20 of lactation). In ewes necropsied at parturition, mammary glands were heavier (P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) in EXC compared to RES, with CON intermediate. Concentration of RNA (mg/g) was decreased (P\\u2009=\\u20090.01) in EXC compared to CON at parturition. There was a tendency (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07) for a Se by nutrition interaction in percentage of cells proliferating where ASe-EXC ewes had greater (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.02) number of proliferating cells then all other treatments. Mammary vascular area tended (P\\u2009=\\u20090.08) to be affected by a Se by nutrition interaction where ASe-CON had less (P\\u2009=\\u20090.007) vascular area than HSe-CON ewes. In ewes necropsied at d 20 of lactation, the number of alveoli per area was decreased (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05) in RES compared to CON and EXC-fed ewes.ConclusionsResults of this study indicate that proper maternal nutritional plane during gestation is important for mammary gland development, even out to d 20 of lactation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a major foodborne pathogen worldwide. S. Typhimurium encodes type III secretion systems via Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI), producing the major effector proteins of virulence. Previously, we identified two genes of Salmonella pyruvate metabolism that were up-regulated during chicken cell infection: pyruvate formate lyase I (pflB) and bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE). We were therefore interested in examining the role these genes may play in the transmission of Salmonella to humans.MethodsMutant strains of Salmonella with single gene deletions for pflB and adhE were created. Invasion and growth in human HCT-8 intestinal epithelial cells and THP-1 macrophages was examined. Quantitative PCR was performed on 19 SPI-1 genes.ResultsIn HCT-8 cells, both mutant strains had significantly higher intracellular counts than the wild-type from 4 to 48\\xa0h post-infection. Various SPI-1 genes in the mutants were up-regulated over the wild-type as early as 1\\xa0h and lasting until 24\\xa0h post-infection. In THP-1 cells, no significant difference in internal Salmonella counts was observed; however, SPI-1 genes were largely down-regulated in the mutants during the time-course of infection. We also found five SPI-1 genes - hilA, hilC hilD, sicP and rtsA - which were up-regulated in at least one of the mutant strains in log-phase broth cultures alone. We have therefore identified a set of SPI-1 virulence genes whose regulation is effected by the central metabolism of Salmonella.',\n",

       " 'The development of new/different management and feeding strategies to stimulate gut development and health in newly-weaned pigs, in order to improve growth performance while minimizing the use of antimicrobial compounds such as antibiotic growth promotants (AGP) and heavy mineral compounds, is essential for the long-term sustainability of the pig industry. Factors including the sub-optimal intake of nutrients and energy, inappropriate microbiota biomass and (or) balance, immature and compromised immune function, and psychosomatic factors caused by weaning can compromise both the efficiency of digestion and absorption and intestinal barrier function through mucosal damage and alteration of tight junction integrity. As a consequence, pigs at weaning are highly susceptible to pathogenic enteric conditions such as post-weaning diarrhea that may be caused by serotypes of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Many dietary components, e.g., protein, fiber, feed additives and minerals, are known to influence microbial growth in the gastrointestinal tract that in turn can impact upon pig growth and health, although the relationships between these are sometimes not necessarily apparent or obvious. In a world climate of increased scrutiny over the use of antibiotics per se in pig production, certain feed additives are seen as alternatives/replacements to antibiotics, and have evolved in some cases to have important roles in everyday commercial pig nutrition. Nevertheless and in general, there remains inconsistency and variability in the efficacy of some feed additives and in cases of severe disease outbreaks, for example, therapeutic antibiotics and/or heavy minerals such as zinc oxide (ZnO) are generally relied upon. If feed ingredients and (or) feed additives are to be used with greater regularity and reliability, then it is necessary to better understand the mechanisms whereby antibiotics and minerals such as ZnO influence animal physiology, in conjunction with the use of appropriate challenge models and in vitro and in vivo techniques.',\n",
       " 'This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary ratios of n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on the performance of lactating sows and their piglets. Thirty pregnant Landrace sows were assigned to one of three treatments from d 108 of gestation until weaning (26–29 d) and were fed diets containing different ratios of n-6:n-3 PUFA including 3:1, 9:1 and 13:1. The effects on sow and litter production traits were examined together with an assessment of sow body condition. No differences were detected among the treatments for the daily feed intake of sows or changes in sow weight and back-fat levels during lactation (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Litter size at d 14 and d 21 were tended to increase in 3:1 treatment compared with 9:1 and 13:1 treatments (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10). Litter weight gain (1.77\\u2009kg/d) from d 0 to d 14 was tended to increase in 9:1 groups compared with the other two treatments (P\\u2009<\\u20090.10). A significant difference was observed for the content of α -linolenic acid, total n-3 PUFA, and the ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFA in the colostrum, milk, and piglets plasma (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The effects of different ratios of n-6:n-3 PUFA in sow diets on colostrum, milk, and piglet plasma immunoglobulin concentrations are studied. No difference was observed among treatments in the concentrations of IgM, and IgA in colostrum (P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). A great significant difference for IgG concentration was observed among 3 group in colostrum. A great significant difference for IgA, and IgM (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01) concentrations in piglet plasma at d14 and a significant difference for IgG(P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) was observed at d14. Furthermore, at d 21 of lactation, piglet plasma IgG and IgA concentration were greater in 3:1 compared with 13:1 group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01).In summary, the current study demonstrated that altering the ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFA in lactating sow diet had an effect on the immune component including immunoglobulin and cytokines, and it tended to increase the litter average daily gain and improve the immune status of piglets when dietary ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFA was 9:1.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundIntake of colostrum after birth is essential to stimulate intestinal growth and function, and to provide systemic immunological protection via absorption of Immunoglobulin G (IgG). The birth order and weight of 745 piglets (from 75 litters) were recorded during a one-week period of farrowing. Only pigs weighing greater than 0.68 kg birth weight were chosen for the trial. Sow colostrum was collected during parturition, and piglets were bled between 48 and 72 hours post-birth. Piglet serum IgG and colostral IgG concentrations were determined by radial immunodiffusion.ResultsSow parity had a significant (P < 0.001) effect on sow colostral IgG concentration, being 5% higher in multiparous females. Sow colostral IgG concentration explained 6% and piglet birth order accounted for another 4% of the variation observed in piglet serum IgG concentration (P < 0.05); however, birth weight had no detectable effect. Piglet serum IgG concentration had both a linear (P < 0.05) and quadratic effect (P < 0.05) on % survival. Piglets with 1,000 mg/dl serum IgG or less (n=24) had a 67% survival; whereas, piglets with IgG concentrations between 2250 to 2500 mg/dl (n=247) had a 91% survival. Birth order had no detectable effect on survival, but birth weight had a positive linear effect (P < 0.05). Piglets weighing 0.9 kg (n = 107) at birth had a 68% survival rate, and those weighing 1.6 kg (n = 158) had an 89% survival.ConclusionWe found that the combination of sow colostrum IgG concentration and birth order can account for 10% of the variation of piglet serum IgG concentration and that piglets with less than 1,000 mg/dl IgG serum concentration and weight of 0.9 kg at birth had low survival rate when compared to their larger siblings. The effective management of colostrum uptake in neonatal piglets in the first 24 hrs post-birth may potentially improve survival from birth to weaning.',\n",
       " 'Ascites syndrome is still a problem for chicken industry in various parts of the world. Despite the intensive investigations of this syndrome for many years, its pathogenesis remains unclear. The objective of this study was to analyze the difference in hepatic proteomics between ascites and healthy broilers by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Changes of biochemical parameters of liver and blood were also determined. The results indicated that red blood cell counts (RBC), hematocrit (HCT) and haemoglobin (HGB) of ascites broilers were significantly greater than healthy broilers. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) level of ascites broilers was significantly increased, and the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) was significantly decreased. Hepatic lactic acid (LD) level of ascitic broilers were significantly lower than healthy ones. Serum glucose and cholesterol level of ascites broilers were significantly increased, and serum globulin level was significantly decreased in ascites broilers. There was no significant difference in triglyceride (TG) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. The activity of liver hexokinase (HK) and succinodehydrogenase (SDH) in ascites broilers was significantly decreased, and there was no significant difference in the activity of liver pyruvate kinase (PK) and Na+-K+-ATPase. The hepatic proteomics analysis showed that 18 proteins expression difference were identified between ascites and healthy broilers. These proteins were mainly involved in: 1) cytoskeleton; 2) glucose, lipids and amino acid metabolism; 3) cell secretion; 4) cell apoptosis; 5) signal transduction; 6) immune and inflammatory response; and 7) cellular redox homeostasis. Mitochondrial isoform phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (M-PEPCK) mainly participates in gluconeogenesis of chicken liver. In conclusion, liver oxidative damage was significantly aggravated, but antioxidant capacity was decreased in cold-induced ascites broilers. Serum glucose level was significantly increased, with liver M-PEPCK expression higher in ascites broilers, which implied that some potential regulatory reagents may reduce ascites susceptibility and mortality under cold temperature by increasing liver gluconeogenesis level.',\n",
       " 'In complex feed structures, there exist main chemical functional groups which are associated with nutrient utilization and availability and functionality. Each functional group has unique molecular structure therefore produce unique molecular vibration spectral profile. Feed processing has been used to improve nutrient utilization for many years. However, to date, there was little study on processing-induced changes of feed intrinsic structure and functional groups on a molecular basis within intact tissue. This is because limited research technique is available to study inherent structure on a molecular basis. Recently bioanalytical techniques: such as Synchrotron Infrared Microspectroscopy as well as Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform molecular spectroscopy have been developed. These techniques enable to detect molecular structure change within intact tissues. These techniques can prevent destruction or alteration of the intrinsic protein structures during processing for analysis. However, these techniques have not been used in animal feed and nutrition research. The objective of this review was show that with the advanced technique, sensitivity and responses of functional groups to feed processing on a molecular basis could be detected in my research team. These functional groups are highly associated with nutrient utilization in animals.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundFibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) inhibits growth-plate chondrocyte proliferation and limits bone elongation. Gain-of-function FGFR3 mutations cause dwarfism, reduced telomerase activity and shorter telomeres in growth plate chondroyctes suggesting that FGFR3 reduces proliferative capacity, inhibits telomerase, and enhances senescence. Thyroid hormone (T3) plays a role in cellular maturation of growth plate chondrocytes and a known target of T3 is FGFR3. The present study addressed whether reduced FGFR3 expression enhanced telomerase activity, mRNA expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and RNA component of telomerase (TR), and chondrocyte proliferation, and whether the stimulation of FGFR3 by T3 evoked the opposite response.ResultsSheep growth-plate proliferative zone chondrocytes were cultured and transfected with siRNA to reduce FGFR3 expression; FGFR3 siRNA reduced chondrocyte FGFR3 mRNA and protein resulting in greater proliferation and increased TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Chondrocytes treated with T3 significantly enhanced FGFR3 mRNA and protein expression and reduced telomerase activity (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05); TERT and TR were not significantly reduced. The action of T3 at the growth plate may be partially mediated through the FGFR3 pathway.ConclusionsThe results suggest that FGFR3 inhibits chondrocyte proliferation by down-regulating TERT expression and reducing telomerase activity indicating an important role for telomerase in sustaining chondrocyte proliferative capacity during bone elongation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundSheep is important in the socio-economic lives of people around the world. It is estimated that more than half of our once common livestock breeds are now endangered. Since genetic characterization of Nigerian sheep is still lacking, we analyzed ten morphological traits on 402 animals and 15 microsatellite DNA markers in 384 animals of the 4 Nigerian sheep breeds to better understand genetic diversity for breeding management and germplasm conservation.ResultsMorphological traits of Uda and Balami were significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) higher than Yankasa, which were both higher than West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed tail length, rump height, chest girth, ear length and chest depth as the most discriminating variables for classification. Mahalanobis distances show the least differentiation between Uda and Balami and the largest between WAD and Balami sheep. While 93.3% of WAD sheep were correctly assigned to their source genetic group, 63.9% of Yankasa, 61.2% of Balami and 45.2% of Uda were classified correctly by nearest neighbour discriminant analysis. The overall high Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) of all microsatellite markers ranged from 0.751 to 0.927 supporting their use in genetic characterization. Expected heterozygosity was high for all loci (0.783 to 0.93). Mean heterozygote deficiency across all populations (0.171 to 0.534) possibly indicate significant inbreeding (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Mean values for FST, FIT and FIS statistics across all loci were 0.088, 0.394 and 0.336 respectively. Yankasa and Balami are the most closely related breeds (DA\\u2009=\\u20090.184) while WAD and Balami are the farthest apart breeds (DA\\u2009=\\u20090.665), which is coincident with distance based on morphological analysis and population structure assessed by STRUCTURE.ConclusionsThese results suggest that within-breed genetic variation in Nigerian sheep is higher than between-breeds and may be a valuable tool for genetic improvement and conservation. The higher genetic variability in Yankasa suggests the presence of unique ancestral alleles reflecting the presence of certain functional genes which may result in better adaptability in more agro-ecological zones of Nigeria. These genetic characteristics are potentially useful in planning improvement and conservation strategies in Nigerian indigenous sheep.',\n",
       " 'The synchronization and ovulatory responses of Sangsari cross bred ewes and metabolism of energy substrates in 8-cell stage embryos to hatched blastocysts stage produced in vitro or in vivo were investigated. Ewes were assigned randomly to receive 37.5 IU of porcine follicle stimulating hormone (FSH-P) daily for the 3 days preceding implant removal (Day 0). Synchronization of estrus was carried out using a 1.5 mg norgestomet (Crestar) ear implant for 12 days. Ewes in estrus were mated two to three times with rams of proven fertility. At the time of first mating each ewe was administered 1000 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to induce ovulation. Surgical embryo recovery was performed on Days 4 and 6 after onset of estrus (Day 0) and recovered embryos were subjected to comparative metabolism studies with in vitro derived embryos at the same stage of development. The number of corpora lutea (CL), unovulated follicles and overall ovarian activity were recorded for each ewe during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. While the pattern of oxidation was similar among in vitro and in vivo derived embryos, a low pyruvate to lactate ratio was the preferred substrate of embryos derived in vitro. A high level of production of CO2 and lactate resulted from a stress response to the suboptimal culture environment. The first marked increase in the metabolism of glucose by ovine embryos was detected in compact morula stage, but there was no significant increase in the oxidation of glucose after the morula stage. Two different concentrations of glucose were compared, but this did not affect metabolism. However, the rate of incorporation and metabolism of glucose tended to be higher at the 0.56 mmol/L glucose dosage.',\n",

The purpose of this study was to identify the most stable housekeeping genes in porcine articular cartilage subjected to a mechanical injury from a panel of 10 candidate genes.ResultsTen candidate housekeeping genes were evaluated in three different treatment groups of mechanically impacted porcine articular cartilage. The genes evaluated were: beta actin, beta-2-microglobulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hydroxymethylbilane synthase, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase, peptidylprolyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A), ribosomal protein L4, succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit A, TATA box binding protein, and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein—zeta polypeptide. The stability of the genes was measured using geNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder software. The four most stable genes measured via geNorm were (most to least stable) succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein, subunit A, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta actin; the four most stable genes measured via BestKeeper were glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, beta actin, succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein, subunit A; and the four most stable genes measured via NormFinder were peptidylprolyl isomerase A, succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein, subunit A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta actin.ConclusionsBestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder all generated similar results for the most stable genes in porcine articular cartilage. The use of these appropriate reference genes will facilitate accurate gene expression studies of porcine articular cartilage and suggest appropriate housekeeping genes for articular cartilage studies in other species.',\n",

       " 'Over the past years, infectious disease has caused enormous economic loss in pig industry. Among the pathogens, gram negative bacteria not only cause inflammation, but also cause different diseases and make the pigs more susceptible to virus infection. Vaccination, medication and elimination of sick pigs are major strategies of controlling disease. Genetic methods, such as selection of disease resistance in the pig, have not been widely used. Recently, the completion of the porcine whole genome sequencing has provided powerful tools to identify the genome regions that harboring genes controlling disease or immunity. Immunogenomics, which combines DNA variations, transcriptome, immune response, and QTL mapping data to illustrate the interactions between pathogen and host immune system, will be an effective genomics tool for identification of disease resistance genes in pigs. These genes will be potential targets for disease resistance in breeding programs. This paper reviewed the progress of disease resistance study in the pig focusing on Gram-negative bacilli. Major porcine Gram-negative bacilli and diseases, suggested candidate genes/pathways against porcine Gram-negative bacilli, and distributions of QTLs for immune capacity on pig chromosomes were summarized. Some tools for immunogenomics research were described. We conclude that integration of sequencing, whole genome associations, functional genomics studies, and immune response information is necessary to illustrate molecular mechanisms and key genes in disease resistance.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundMuscle growth depends on the fusion of proliferate satellite cells to existing myofibers. We reported previously that 0–14 day intermittent feeding led to persistent retardation in myofiber hypertrophy. However, how satellite cells respond to such nutritional insult has not been adequately elucidated.ResultsOne-day-old broiler chicks were allocated to control (Con, ad libitum feeding), intermittent feeding (IF, feed provided on alternate days) and re-feeding (RF, 2 days ad libitum feeding after 12 days of intermittent feeding) groups. Chickens were killed on Day 15 and satellite cells were isolated. When cultured, satellite cells from the IF group demonstrated significant retardation in proliferation and differentiation potential, while RF partly restored the proliferation rate and differentiation potential of the satellite cells. Significant up-regulation of insulin like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) (P< 0.05) and thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) (P< 0.05), and down-regulation of growth hormone receptor (GHR) (P< 0.01) and IGF-I (P< 0.01) mRNA expression was observed in freshly isolated IF satellite cells when compared with Con cells. In RF cells, the mRNA expression of IGF-I was higher (P< 0.05) and of TRα was lower (P< 0.01) than in IF cells, suggesting that RF restored the mRNA expression of TRα and IGF-I, but not of GHR and IGF-IR. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio tended to increase in the IF group, which was reversed in the RF group (P< 0.05), indicating that RF reduced the pro-apoptotic influence of IF. Moreover, no significant effect of T3 was detected on cell survival in IF cells compared with Con (P<0.001) or RF (P< 0.05) cells.ConclusionsThese data suggest that early-age feed restriction inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells, induces changes in mRNA expression of the GH/IGF-I and thyroid hormone receptors in satellite cells, as well as blunted sensitivity of satellite cells to T3, and that RF partially reverses these effects. Thus, a moderate nutritional strategy for feed restriction should be chosen in early chick rearing systems.',\n",
       " 'Backgroundα-galactosidase has been widely used in animal husbandry to reduce anti-nutritional factors (such as α-galactoside) in feed. Intestine-specific and substrate inducible expression of α-galactosidase would be highly beneficial for transgenic animal production.MethodsTo achieve the intestine-specific and substrate inducible expression of α-galactosidase, we first identified intestine-specific promoters by comparing the transcriptional activity and tissue specificity of four intestine-specific promoters from human intestinal fatty acid binding protein, rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein, human mucin-2 and human lysozyme. We made two chimeric constructs combining the promoter and enhancer of human mucin-2, rat intestinal trefoil factor and human sucrase-isomaltase. Then a modified lac operon system was constructed to investigate the induction of α-galactosidase expression and enzyme activity by isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and an α-galactosidase substrate, α-lactose.We declared that the research carried out on human (Zhai Yafeng) was in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, and experimental research on animals also followed internationally recognized guidelines.ResultsThe activity of the human mucin-2 promoter was about 2 to 3 times higher than that of other intestine-specific promoters. In the lac operon system, the repressor significantly decreased (P < 0.05) luciferase activity by approximately 6.5-fold and reduced the percentage of cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) by approximately 2-fold. In addition, the expression level of α-galactosidase mRNA was decreased by 6-fold and α-galactosidase activity was reduced by 8-fold. In line with our expectations, IPTG and α-lactose supplementation reversed (P < 0.05) the inhibition and produced a 5-fold increase of luciferase activity, an 11-fold enhancement in the percentage of cells with GFP expression and an increase in α-galactosidase mRNA abundance (by about 5-fold) and α-galactosidase activity (by about 7-fold).ConclusionsWe have successfully constructed a high specificity inducible lac operon system in an intestine-derived cell line, which could be of great value for gene therapy applications and transgenic animal production.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundSoybean isoflavones are structurally similar to mammalian estrogens and therefore may act as estrogen agonists or antagonists. However, it has not been determined if they have any negative effects on reproductive parameters in male livestock. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soybean isoflavones on male reproduction using Chinese mini-pig boars as a model. Fifty Xiang boars were randomly divided into five groups and fed diets containing 0, 125, 250, or 500 ppm soybean isoflavones or 0.5 ppm diethylstilbestrol for 60 days.ResultsDietary supplementation with 250 ppm of soy isoflavones markedly increased the testis index (P < 0.05), fructose content (P < 0.05), and α-glycosidase content in testicular tissue (P < 0.01), as well as increased the number of viable germ cells (P < 0.01) and the level of Bcl-2 protein (P < 0.01). However, 500 ppm of soybean isoflavones significantly reduced both testis and epididymis indexes (P < 0.05) and lactate dehydrogenase levels (P < 0.01), as well as reduced serum LH and testosterone levels (P < 0.05). High levels of soybean isoflavones also increased malondialdehyde levels (P < 0.05), as well as increased the numbers of early and late apoptotic germ cells (P < 0.01) and the level of Bax proteins (P < 0.05) in the testis.ConclusionsThe results of this study indicate that consumption of soy isoflavones at dietary levels up to 250 ppm did not adversely affect reproductive parameters in Chinese mini-pig boars whereas higher levels of soy isoflavones may adversely affect male reproduction.',\n",
       " 'In the present study, the effect of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) on long-chain fatty acid oxidation by hepatocytes isolated from suckled neonatal pig liver (a low ketogenic and lipogenic tissue) was tested. Incubation of hepatocytes with AICAR (0.5 mM) in the presence of 1 mM of carnitine and 10 mM of glucose for 1 hour at 37°C had no significant effect on total [1-14C]-palmitate (0.5 mM) oxidation (14CO2 and 14C-Acid soluble products (ASP)). Consistent with the fatty acid oxidation, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity and inhibition of its activity by malonyl-CoA (10 μM) assayed in cell homogenate also remained constant. However, addition of AICAR to the hepatocytes decreased 14CO2 production by 18% compared to control (p < 0.06). The reduction of labeled carboxylic carbon accumulated in CO2 caused a significant difference in distribution of oxidative products between 14CO2 and 14C-ASP (p < 0.03) compared with the control. It was also noticed that acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was increased by AICAR (p < 0.03), indicating that ACC might drive acetyl-CoA toward fatty acid synthesis pathway and induce an increase in distribution of fatty acid carbon to 14C-ASP. Addition of insulin to hepatocyte incubations with AICAR did not change the oxidative product distribution between CO2 and ASP, but further promoted ACC activity. The increased ACC activity was 70% higher than in the control group when citrate was absent in the reaction medium and was 30% higher when citrate was present in the medium. Our results suggest that AICAR may affect the distribution of metabolic products from fatty acid oxidation by changing ACC activity in hepatocyte isolated from suckled neonatal piglets; however, the basis for the increase in ACC activity elicited by AICAR is not apparent.',\n",
       " 'Diphtheria toxin A (DTA), a segment of the diphtheria toxin (tox), inhibits protein synthesis in cells. When released from a cell, DTA is nontoxic and cannot enter other cells independently without the help of diphtheria toxin B. In this study, we artificially synthesized the DTA gene sequence and cloned it into pEGFP-N1 to generate the recombinant vector pEGFP-N1-DTA. This recombinant vector was then transfected into 293T cells to observe the effect of DTA protein expression on enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) protein expression and the proliferation of 293T cells. After 48 h, high levels of EGFP expression were seen in control pEGFP-N1-transfected cells, whereas very low levels were seen in cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-DTA. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the expression of the DTA gene in cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-DTA. Further, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay revealed a significant difference in cell proliferation between the control group and the pEGFP-N1-DTA-transfected group. Using the expression of EGFP expression as an indicator, this study revealed that DTA expression can inhibit intracellular protein synthesis and cell proliferation.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundThe number and diversity of uncultured ruminal bacterial and archaeal species revealed by 16S rRNA gene (rrs) sequences greatly exceeds that of cultured bacteria and archaea. However, the significance of uncultured microbes remains undetermined. The objective of this study was to assess the numeric importance of select uncultured bacteria and cultured bacteria and the impact of diets and microenvironments within cow rumen in a comparative manner.ResultsLiquid and adherent fractions were obtained from the rumen of Jersey cattle fed hay alone and Holstein cattle fed hay plus grain. The populations of cultured and uncultured bacteria present in each fraction were quantified using specific real-time PCR assays. The population of total bacteria was similar between fractions or diets, while total archaea was numerically higher in the hay-fed Jersey cattle than in the hay-grain-fed Holstein cattle. The population of the genus Prevotella was about one log smaller than that of total bacteria. The populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the genus Butyrivibrio, and R. albus was at least one log smaller than that of genus Prevotella. Four of the six uncultured bacteria quantified were as abundant as F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens and the genus Butyrivibrio. In addition, the populations of several uncultured bacteria were significantly higher in the adherent fractions than in the liquid fractions. These uncultured bacteria may be associated with fiber degradation.ConclusionsSome uncultured bacteria are as abundant as those of major cultured bacteria in the rumen. Uncultured bacteria may have important contribution to ruminal fermentation. Population dynamic studies of uncultured bacteria in a comparative manner can help reveal their ecological features and importance to rumen functions.',\n",
       " 'Feed intake control is vital to ensuring optimal nutrition and achieving full potential for growth and development in poultry. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of L-leucine, L-glutamate, L-tryptophan and L-arginine on feed intake and the mRNA expression levels of hypothalamic Neuropeptide involved in feed intake regulation in broiler chicks. Leucine, glutamate, tryptophan or arginine was intra-cerebroventricularly (ICV) administrated to 4d-old broiler chicks respectively and the feed intake were recorded at various time points. Quantitative PCR was performed to determine the hypothalamic mRNA expression levels of Neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti related protein (AgRP), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). Our results showed that ICV administration of L-leucine (0.15 or 1.5\\u2009\\u2009μmol) significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) increased feed intake up to 2\\u2009h post-administration period and elevated both hypothalamic NPY and AgRP mRNA expression levels. In contrast, ICV administration of L-glutamate (1.6\\u2009\\u2009μmol) significantly (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) decreased feed intake 0.25, 0.5 and 2\\u2009h post-injection, and increased hypothalamic CRF and MC4R mRNA expression levels. Meanwhile, both L-tryptophan (10 or 100\\u2009\\u2009μg) and L-arginine (20 or 200\\u2009\\u2009μg) had no significant effect on feed intake. These findings suggested that L-leucine and L-glutamate could act within the hypothalamus to influence food intake, and that both orexigenic and anorexigenic Neuropeptide genes might contribute directly to these effects.',\n",
       " 'Domestic animals are invaluable resources for study of the molecular architecture of complex traits. Although the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for economically important traits in domestic animals has achieved remarkable results in recent decades, not all of the genetic variation in the complex traits has been captured because of the low density of markers used in QTL mapping studies. The genome wide association study (GWAS), which utilizes high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), provides a new way to tackle this issue. Encouraging achievements in dissection of the genetic mechanisms of complex diseases in humans have resulted from the use of GWAS. At present, GWAS has been applied to the field of domestic animal breeding and genetics, and some advances have been made. Many genes or markers that affect economic traits of interest in domestic animals have been identified. In this review, advances in the use of GWAS in domestic animals are described.',\n",

Pastures contained 1 of the following 3 seeding mixtures (2 pastures/mixture): 1) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam., WRG), 2) wheat and ryegrass plus red clover (Trifolium pretense L., WRR), or 3) wheat and ryegrass plus white (Trifolium repens L.) and crimson clovers (Trifolium incarnatum L., WRW). All groups had ad libitum access to grass hay (12% crude protein; 58% total digestible nutrients). The second week in December, cow estrous cycles were synchronized and artificially inseminated. In late December, a bull was placed with each group for 60-d. Data were analyzed with an analysis of variance using a mixed model containing treatment as the fixed effect and year as the random effect. Body weight and condition scores did not differ (P ≥ 0.27) among cows between February and June. Calf birth weights or average daily gain did not differ (P\\u2009≥\\u20090.17) among treatments; however, calves grazing pastures with clovers did tend (P\\u2009=\\u20090.06) to weigh more than calves grazing grass only. Weaning weight per cow exposed to a bull was greater (P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) for WRR and WRW than WRG. Cows grazing winter-annual pastures containing clovers tended to wean more calf body weight per cow exposed to a bull than cows grazing the grass only pastures.',\n",
       " 'BackgroundComplex vertebral malformation (CVM) and bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD) are two autosomal recessive lethal genetic defects frequently occurring in Holstein cattle, identifiable by single nucleotide polymorphisms. The objective of this study is to develop a rapid and reliable genotyping assay to screen the active Holstein sires and determine the carrier frequency of CVM and BLAD in Chinese dairy cattle population.ResultsWe developed real-time PCR-based assays for discrimination of wild-type and defective alleles, so that carriers can be detected. Only one step was required after the DNA extraction from the sample and time consumption was about 2 hours. A total of 587 Chinese Holstein bulls were assayed, and fifty-six CVM-carriers and eight BLAD-carriers were identified, corresponding to heterozygote carrier frequencies of 9.54% and 1.36%, respectively. The pedigree analysis showed that most of the carriers could be traced back to the common ancestry, Osborndale Ivanhoe for BLAD and Pennstate Ivanhoe Star for CVM.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that real-time PCR is a simple, rapid and reliable assay for BLAD and CVM defective allele detection. The high frequency of the CVM allele suggests that implementing a routine testing system is necessary to gradually eradicate the deleterious gene from the Chinese Holstein population.',\n",
       " 'There is a dialogue between the developing conceptus (embryo-fetus and associated placental membranes) and maternal uterus which must be established during the peri-implantation period for pregnancy recognition signaling, implantation, regulation of gene expression by uterine epithelial and stromal cells, placentation and exchange of nutrients and gases. The uterus provide a microenvironment in which molecules secreted by uterine epithelia or transported into the uterine lumen represent histotroph required for growth and development of the conceptus and receptivity of the uterus to implantation. Pregnancy recognition signaling mechanisms sustain the functional lifespan of the corpora lutea (CL) which produce progesterone, the hormone of pregnancy essential for uterine functions that support implantation and placentation required for a successful outcome of pregnancy. It is within the peri-implantation period that most embryonic deaths occur due to deficiencies attributed to uterine functions or failure of the conceptus to develop appropriately, signal pregnancy recognition and/or undergo implantation and placentation. With proper placentation, the fetal fluids and fetal membranes each have unique functions to ensure hematotrophic and histotrophic nutrition in support of growth and development of the fetus. The endocrine status of the pregnant female and her nutritional status are critical for successful establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. This review addresses the complexity of key mechanisms that are characteristic of successful reproduction in sheep and pigs and gaps in knowledge that must be the subject of research in order to enhance fertility and reproductive health of livestock species.',\n",
       " 'Barley grain (Hordeum vulgare L.) is characterized by a thick fibrous coat, a high level of ß-glucans and simply-arranged starch granules. World production of barley is about 30 % of that of corn. In comparison with corn, barley has more protein, methionine, lysine, cysteine and tryptophan. For ruminants, barley is the third most readily degradable cereal behind oats and wheat. Due to its more rapid starch fermentation rate compared with corn, barley also provides a more synchronous release of energy and nitrogen, thereby improving microbial nutrient assimilation. As a result, feeding barley can reduce the need for feeding protected protein sources. However, this benefit is only realized if rumen acidity is maintained within an optimal range (e.g., > 5.8 to 6.0); below this range, microbial maintenance requirements and wastage increase. With a low pH, microbial endotoxines cause pro-inflammatory responses that can weaken immunity and shorten animal longevity. Thus, mismanagement in barley processing and feeding may make a tragedy from this treasure or pearl of cereal grains. Steam-rolling of barley may improve feed efficiency and post-rumen starch digestion. However, it is doubtful if such processing can improve milk production and feed intake. Due to the need to process barley less extensively than other cereals (as long as the pericarp is broken), consistent and global standards for feeding and processing barley could be feasibly established. In high-starch diets, barley feeding reduces the need for capacious small intestinal starch assimilation, subsequently reducing hindgut starch use and fecal nutrient loss. With its nutritional exclusivities underlined, barley use will be a factual art that can either matchlessly profit or harm rumen microbes, cattle production, farm economics and the environment.',\n",
       " 'The purpose of the study was to test the therapeutic effects of novel vaccines for reducing weight gain and increasing weight loss in diet induced obesity (DIO) model. Male C57BL/6\\u2009J mice, fed a 60% Kcal fat diet for 8\\u2009weeks prior to the start of the study, were vaccinated via the intraperitoneal route with two formulations (JH17 & JH18) of chimeric-somatostatin vaccines at 1 and 22\\u2009days of the study. Control mice were injected with PBS. All mice continued to be feed the 60% Kcal fat diet for the 6\\u2009week study. Body weights were measured two times a week and food intake was measured weekly. At week 6, mice were euthanized and a terminal bleed was made and antibody levels to somatostatin and levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were determined. Vaccination with both vaccine formulations induced a statistically significant body weight change over the study period, as compared with PBS controls. Percentage of baseline body weight was also significantly affected by vaccination during the study period. Vaccinates finished the study at 104% and 107% of baseline weight, JH17 & JH18 respectively, while untreated controls reached 115% of baseline weight. Food intake per mouse was similar in all mouse groups during the entire study. Control mice did not demonstrate any antibody titers to somatostatin, while all vaccinated mice had measurable antibody responses (> 1:500,000 titer). IGF-1 levels were not statistically significant among the groups, but were elevated in the JH18 vaccinates (mean 440.4\\u2009ng/mL) when compared with PBS controls (mean 365.6\\u2009ng/mL). Vaccination with either JH17 or JH18 chimeric –somatostatin vaccines produced a statistically significant weight loss as compared with PBS controls (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), even though the DIO mice with continually fed a 60% Kcal fat diet. The weight loss/lower weight gain observations were even more significant, as all mice consumed similar amounts of food for the entire study. The presence of high levels of anti-somatostatin antibodies at 6\\u2009weeks was correlative with the weight observations and confirmed the success of vaccination.',\n",

Four livestock species—cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses—express a full range of Ig heavy chains (IgHs), including μ, δ, γ, ϵ, and α. Two poultry species (chickens and ducks) express three IgH isotypes, μ, υ, and α, but not δ. The κ and λ light chains are both utilized in the four livestock species, but only the λ chain is expressed in poultry.

       " 'BackgroundA leptin-like immunoreactive substance has been found in chicken eggs and has been implicated in serving as a maternal signal to program offspring growth and metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the effects of in ovo leptin administration on hatch weight, serum and hepatic concentrations of metabolites and hormones, as well as on the expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and the predicted microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the affected genes. To this end we injected fertile eggs with either 0.5 μg of recombinant murine leptin or vehicle (PBS) before incubation.ResultsPrenatally leptin-exposed chicks showed lower hatch weight, but higher liver weight relative to the body weight, compared to the control group. In ovo leptin treatment increased the hepatic content and serum concentration of leptin in newly hatched chickens. The hepatic contents of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (Tch) were decreased, whereas the serum levels of TG, Tch and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) were increased. The hepatic mRNA expression of sterol regulator element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), SREBP-2, hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1) was significantly up-regulated, as was the protein content of both SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 in hepatic nuclear extracts of leptin-treated chickens. Moreover, out of 12 miRNAs targeting SREBP-1c and/or HMGCR, five were significantly up-regulated in liver of leptin-treated chicks, including gga-miR-200b and gga-miR-429, which target both SREBP-1c and HMGCR.ConclusionsThese results suggest that leptin in ovo decreases hatch weight, and modifies hepatic leptin secretion and lipid metabolism in newly hatched broiler chickens, possibly via microRNA-mediated gene regulation.',\n",
       " 'Cathelicidins are a major family of antimicrobial peptides present in vertebrate animals with potent microbicidal and immunomodulatory activities. Four cathelicidins, namely fowlicidins 1 to 3 and cathelicidin B1, have been identified in chickens. As a first step to understand their role in early innate host defense of chickens, we examined the tissue and developmental expression patterns of all four cathelicidins. Real-time PCR revealed an abundant expression of four cathelicidins throughout the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts as well as in all primary and secondary immune organs of chickens. Fowlicidins 1 to 3 exhibited a similar tissue expression pattern with the highest expression in the bone marrow and lung, while cathelicidin B1 was synthesized most abundantly in the bursa of Fabricius. Additionally, a tissue-specific regulatory pattern was evident for all four cathelicidins during the first 28 days after hatching. The expression of fowlicidins 1 to 3 showed an age-dependent increase both in the cecal tonsil and lung, whereas all four cathelicidins were peaked in the bursa on day 4 after hatching, with a gradual decline by day 28. An abrupt augmentation in the expression of fowlicidins 1 to 3 was also observed in the cecum on day 28, while the highest expression of cathelicidin B1 was seen in both the lung and cecal tonsil on day 14. Collectively, the presence of cathelicidins in a broad range of tissues and their largely enhanced expression during development are suggestive of their potential important role in early host defense and disease resistance of chickens.',\n",

However, more studies are needed to illustrate the mechanism through which dietary isotopic ratios influence the extent of isotopic incorporation into the tissues.',\n",
       " 'A total of 335 lactating sows (Landrace × Large White) were used in two experiments to determine the optimum ratio of standardized ileal digestible lysine (SID-Lys) to metabolizable energy (ME) for mixed parity sows during lactation. In Exp. 1, 185 sows (weighing an average of 256.2 ± 6.5 kg and having an average parity of 3.4 ± 0.3) were allocated to one of six experimental diets in a completely randomized block design within parity groups (1, 2, and 3+). The experimental diets were formulated to contain 3.06, 3.16, 3.20, 3.25, 3.30 or 3.40 Mcal/kg of ME and each diet was fed to the sows throughout a 28 day lactation. All diets provided a similar SID-lysine level (0.86%). As a result, the diets provided a SID-Lys:ME ratio of 2.81, 2.72, 2.69, 2.65, 2.61 or 2.53 g/Mcal ME. Sow feed intake was significantly (P < 0.01) affected by the energy content of the diet as well as by sow parity. Using regression analysis, feed intake was shown to be maximized at 3.25, 3.21, 3.21 and 3.21 Mcal/kg of ME for parity 1, 2, 3+ sows and the entire cohort of sows respectively (quadratic; P < 0.01). In addition, the result of feed intake can be expressed as 2.65, 2.69, 2.69 and 2.68 g/Mcal based on analysis of SID-Lys:ME ratio. Litter weight gain was affected by dietary treatment for parity 3+ sows and the entire cohort (P < 0.01). Based on regression analysis, litter weight gain was maximized at 3.25 and 3.24 Mcal/kg of ME for parity 3+ (quadratic; P < 0.01) and the entire cohort (quadratic; P < 0.01). Similarly, the result of litter weight gain could be expressed as 2.65 and 2.66 g/Mcal of SID-Lys:ME ratio. Therefore, 3.25 Mcal/kg of ME was selected for Exp. 2 in which 150 sows (weighing 254.6 ± 7.3 kg and having an average parity of 3.4 ± 0.4) were allocated to one of five treatments in a completely randomized block design within parity (1, 2, and 3+). The experimental diets were formulated to contain 2.1, 2.4, 2.7, 3.0 or 3.3 g/Mcal of SID-Lys:ME ratio with all diets providing 3.25 Mcal/kg of ME. The diets were fed to the sows throughout a 28 day lactation. Sow body weight loss was affected by dietary treatment (parity 3+ sows, P = 0.02; entire cohort, P < 0.01) and by sow parity (P < 0.01). Litter weight at weaning and litter weight gain were affected by dietary treatment for parity 1, 2, 3+ sows and the entire cohort (P < 0.01) as well as by sow parity (P < 0.01). Plasma urea nitrogen (P < 0.01), creatinine (P < 0.01) and non-esterifide fatty acids (P = 0.04) were decreased as the SID-Lys:ME ratio of the diet increased.

       " \"Little information is available about the nutritive value of expanded soybean meal, which is produced by expansion of soybeans prior to solvent extraction of the oil. During processing, expanded soybean meal is subjected to additional heat, which might increase the concentration of ruminally undegraded protein. Processing of soybeans with heat during oil extraction could affect lysine availability by increasing ruminally undegraded protein or by impairing intestinal digestion. Our objective was to compare solvent and expanded soybeans with regard to chemical composition and nutritive value for dairy cattle. Samples of expanded soybean meal (n = 14) and solvent-extracted soybean meal (n = 5) were obtained from People's Republic of China to study effects of the expansion process on nutritive value for dairy cattle. Solvent-extracted soybean meal (n = 2) and mechanically extracted (heated) soybean meal (n = 2) from the United States served as references for comparison. Samples were analyzed for crude fat, long-chain fatty acids, crude protein, amino acids, chemically available lysine, in situ ruminal protein degradation, and in vitro intestinal digestibility. No differences were found between solvent-extracted soybean meals from China and expanded soybean meals from China for crude fat, crude protein, amino acids, or chemically available lysine. In situ disappearance of nitrogen, ruminally undegraded protein content, and in vitro intestinal digestion of the ruminally undegraded protein were generally similar between solvent-extracted soybean meals made in China and expanded soybean meals made in China; variation among soybean meals was small. Results indicate that the additional heat from the expansion process was not great enough to affect the nutritive value of soybean meal protein for ruminants. Although expansion may improve the oil extraction process, the impact on the resulting soybean meal is minimal and does not require consideration when formulating ruminant diets.\",\n",
       " \"Only in recent years, the draft sequences for several agricultural animals have been assembled. Assembling an individual animal's entire genome sequence or specific region(s) of interest is increasingly important for agricultural researchers to perform genetic comparisons between animals with different performance. We review the current status for several sequenced agricultural species and suggest that next generation sequencing (NGS) technology with decreased sequencing cost and increased speed of sequencing can benefit agricultural researchers. By taking advantage of advanced NGS technologies, genes and chromosomal regions that are more labile to the influence of environmental factors could be pinpointed. A more long term goal would be addressing the question of how animals respond at the molecular and cellular levels to different environmental models (e.g. nutrition). Upon revealing important genes and gene-environment interactions, the rate of genetic improvement can also be accelerated. It is clear that NGS technologies will be able to assist animal scientists to efficiently raise animals and to better prevent infectious diseases so that overall costs of animal production can be decreased.\",\n",

Exps. 1 (30 to 50 kg), 2 (52 to 70 kg) and 3 (81 to 104 kg) were conducted to find an optimum ME level and then this level was used in Exps. 4 (29 to 47 kg), 5 (54 to 76 kg) and 6 (84 to 109 kg) to test the response of pigs to different ratios of SID-Lys:ME. In Exps.1 to 3, four treatments were used consisting of diets with a formulated ME content of 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 in Exps. 1 and 2 while Exp. 3 used 3.05, 3.15, 3.25 or 3.35 Mcal/kg. A constant SID-Lys:ME ratio of 2.6, 2.3 or 2.0 g/Mcal was used in Exps. 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Weight gain was significantly increased with increasing energy level in Exp.1 while weight gain was unaltered in Exps. 2 and 3. For all three experiments, feed intake was decreased (P < 0.05) and feed efficiency was improved (P < 0.05) with increasing energy level. Tenth rib back fat thickness linearly increased (P < 0.05) with increasing energy level.

       " 'Mastitis or other infectious diseases have been related to reduced fertility in cattle. Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are released in response to infection and may have negative effects on embryo development. In the current study the effect of exposure to TNFα on the development of in vitro fertilized bovine embryos was examined. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, was used to determine if blockade of prostaglandin synthesis would alter the effects of TNFα. Ovaries were obtained from a local abattoir and immature COC were isolated from 2-10 mm follicles, in vitro matured and fertilized. After fertilization, groups of presumptive zygotes were randomly placed into either control development medium, medium containing 25 ng/mL TNFα or medium containing 25 ng/mL TNFα plus 1 μg/mL indomethacin. The proportion of blastocysts formed was assessed at day 7 of culture. Fewer embryos exposed to TNFα alone reached the blastocyst stage (17.5 ± 2.4%, P < 0.01) compared with controls (30.5 ± 2.4%) or embryos developed in TNFα plus indomethacin (25.8 ± 2.8%). There was no difference between control embryos and embryos developed in TNFα plus indomethacin. These results indicate that TNFα is inhibitory to the in vitro development of bovine embryos and that this inhibition may be mediated by prostaglandins because it can be blocked by indomethacin.',\n",
       " 'Missing genotypes are a common feature of high density SNP datasets obtained using SNP chip technology and this is likely to decrease the accuracy of genomic selection. This problem can be circumvented by imputing the missing genotypes with estimated genotypes. When implementing imputation, the criteria used for SNP data quality control and whether to perform imputation before or after data quality control need to consider. In this paper, we compared six strategies of imputation and quality control using different imputation methods, different quality control criteria and by changing the order of imputation and quality control, against a real dataset of milk production traits in Chinese Holstein cattle. The results demonstrated that, no matter what imputation method and quality control criteria were used, strategies with imputation before quality control performed better than strategies with imputation after quality control in terms of accuracy of genomic selection. The different imputation methods and quality control criteria did not significantly influence the accuracy of genomic selection. We concluded that performing imputation before quality control could increase the accuracy of genomic selection, especially when the rate of missing genotypes is high and the reference population is small.',\n",

       " 'Recent studies have demonstrated that differentiated somatic cells from various mammalian species can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by the ectopic expression of four transcription factors that are highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The generation of patient-specific iPS cells directly from somatic cells without using oocytes or embryos holds great promise for curing numerous diseases that are currently unresponsive to traditional clinical approaches. However, some recent studies have argued that various iPS cell lines may still retain certain epigenetic memories that are inherited from the somatic cells. Such observations have raised concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of using iPS cell derivatives for clinical applications. Recently, our study demonstrated full pluripotency of mouse iPS cells by tetraploid complementation, indicating that it is possible to obtain fully reprogrammed iPS cells directly from differentiated somatic cells. Therefore, we propose in this review that further comprehensive studies of both mouse and human iPS cells are required so that additional information will be available for evaluating the quality of human iPS cells.',\n",
       " 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs (18-25 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of miRNAs in the blood circulation. Deregulation of miRNAs in serum or plasma has been associated with many diseases including cancers and cardiovascular diseases, suggesting the possible use of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers. However, the detection of the small amount of miRNAs found in serum or plasma requires a method with high sensitivity and accuracy. Therefore, the current study describes polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for measuring circulating miRNAs. Briefly, the procedure involves four major steps: (1) sample collection and preparation; (2) global miRNAs profiling using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); (3) data normalization and analysis; and (4) selection and validation of miRNA biomarkers. In conclusion, qRT-PCR is a promising method for profiling of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers.',\n",
       " 'Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in milk, and lactation is associated with increased glutamine utilization both for milk synthesis and as a fuel for the enlarged small intestine. A number of recent studies have indicated that lactation is accompanied by a mild catabolic state in which skeletal muscle proteins are degraded to provide amino acids that are used to synthesize additional glutamine. In this study we tested the hypothesis that supplemental L-glutamine or the commercially available glutamine supplement Aminogut (2.5% by weight mixed into daily feed) provided to gilts from 30 days prior to parturition until 21 days post-parturition would prevent a decrease in skeletal muscle glutamine while increasing the glutamine content of the milk. Muscle glutamine content decreased (P < 0.05) in control animals during lactation but this was prevented by supplementation with either L-glutamine or Aminogut. In this study, neither lactation nor supplementation had any effect on plasma glutamine or glutamate content. Free glutamine, and the total glutamine plus glutamate concentrations in milk from the control and the Aminogut group rose (P < 0.05) during the first 7 days of lactation, with milk concentrations in the L-glutamine supplemented group showing a similar trend (P = 0.053). Milk glutamate remained constant between day 7 and 21 of lactation in the control and L-glutamine supplemented groups, but by day 21 of lactation the free glutamine, glutamate, and glutamine plus glutamate concentrations in milk from Aminogut-treated gilts were higher than those of control gilts. Thus dietary glutamine supplementation can alleviate the fall in intramuscular glutamine content during lactation in gilts, and may alleviate some of the catabolic effects of lactation. Furthermore, the increased milk glutamine content in the supplemented gilts may provide optimum nutrition for piglet development.',\n",
       " \"Neonatal growth is characterized by a high protein synthesis rate that is largely due to an enhanced sensitivity to the postprandial rise in insulin and amino acids, especially leucine. The mechanism of leucine's action in vivo is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of leucine infusion on protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and liver of neonatal pigs. To evaluate the mode of action of leucine, we used rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex-1 (mTORC1). Overnight-fasted 7-day-old piglets were treated with rapamycin for 1 hour and then infused with leucine (400 μmol·kg-1·h-1) for 1 hour. Leucine infusion increased the rate of protein synthesis, and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1) phosphorylation in gastrocnemius and masseter muscles (P < 0.05), but not in the liver. The leucine-induced stimulation of protein synthesis and S6K1 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation were completely blocked by rapamycin, suggesting that leucine action is by an mTORC1-dependent mechanism. Neither leucine nor rapamycin had any effect on the activation of the upstream mTORC1 regulators, AMP-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B, in skeletal muscle or liver. The activation of eIF2α and elongation factor 2 was not affected by leucine or rapamycin, indicating that these two pathways are not limiting steps of leucine-induced protein synthesis. These results suggest that leucine stimulates muscle protein synthesis in neonatal pigs by inducing the activation of mTORC1 and its downstream pathway leading to mRNA translation.\"]"

Despite a critical role of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in regulating cellular stress response, the crosstalk between mTORC1 and ER stress signaling and its contribution to the intestinal barrier function is unknown.ResultsIn the present study, we showed that intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) incubated with tunicamycin led to caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death. The induction of cell death was accompanied by activation of unfolded protein response as evidenced by increased protein levels for BiP, p-IRE1α, p-eIF2α, p-JNK, and CHOP.

Proline is one of precursors of ornithine, which is converted into polyamines via ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Pro on the polyamine metabolism and cell proliferation in the porcine enterocyte IPEC-J2. Cells cultured with DMEM-H containing 10% FBS and were exposed to 400 μMl-Pro or 400 μMl-Pro + 10 mM α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) for 4 d. The results showed that the ODC protein level and spermidine and spermine contents was increased by l-Pro, but combined addition of l-Pro and DFMO prevented the expression of ODC protein and thus decreased the concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in the IPEC-J2 cells (P &lt; 0.05). The percentage of cells in the S phase was increased in response to l-Pro treatment and depletion of cellular polyamines by exposure to DFMO caused the G1 phase growth arrest (P &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, the mRNA expressions of c-fos and c-myc were elevated in the l-Pro treated IPEC-J2 cells but significantly inhibited by DFMO, and inhibition of polyamine synthesis with DFMO increased p53 mRNA level (P &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, compared with l-Pro supplementation, the combination of l-Pro and DFMO decreased cell apoptosis and the levels of associated proteins, including Bax and cytochrome C (P &lt; 0.05). These findings indicated that Pro promote polyamine synthesis by mediating ODC expression and plays an important role in cell-cycle progression and cell proliferation in the porcine enterocyte IPEC-J2, and polyamine-deficient IPEC-J2 cells may be protected from apoptosis, thereby provided useful information for dietary Pro or polyamine supplementation to improve the health and development of small intestinal mucosa in piglets.'),\n",

       "  'The discovery of postnatal mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) with their general multipotentiality has fueled much interest in the development of cell-based therapies. Proper identification of transplanted MSC is crucial for evaluating donor cell distribution, differentiation, and migration. Lack of an efficient marker of transplanted MSC has precluded our understanding of MSC-related regenerative studies, especially in large animal models such as pigs. In the present study, we produced transgenic pigs harboring an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene. The pigs provide a reliable and reproducible source for obtaining stable EGFP-labeled MSC, which is very useful for donor cell tracking after transplantation. The undifferentiated EGFP-tagged MSC expressed a greater quantity of EGFP while maintaining MSC multipotentiality. These cells exhibited homogeneous surface epitopes and possessed classic trilineage differentiation potential into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages, with robust EGFP expression maintained in all differentiated progeny. Injection of donor MSC can dramatically increase the thickness of infarcted myocardium and improve cardiac function in mice. Moreover, the MSC, with their strong EGFP expression, can be easily distinguished from the background autofluorescence in myocardial infarcts. We demonstrated an efficient, effective, and easy way to identify MSC after long-term culture and transplantation. With the transgenic model, we were able to obtain stem or progenitor cells in earlier passages compared with the transfection of traceable markers into established MSC. Because the integration site of the transgene was the same for all cells, we lessened the potential for positional effects and the heterogeneity of the stem cells. The EGFP-transgenic pigs may serve as useful biomedical and agricultural models of somatic stem cell biology.'),\n",

Probiotics are able to modulate mucosal immune system in the intestine by maintaining intestinal homeostasis and tolerance towards resident microbiota. We previously found a strain of probiotics, Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), to significantly improve mucosal barrier integrity and function of the small intestine in a pig model. The present study is designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of L. plantarum in NK cell-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier function under Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88 infection. To study the effect of L. plantarum on the function of NK cells, a L. plantarum strain CGMCC1258 was cultured with NK-92MI cells without direct contact using a transwell system for 2 to 6 hours before collection of NK cells for mRNA and protein expression analysis. To study the anti-inflammatory potential of L. plantarum in NK cell-mediated epithelial cell integrity, NCM460 (an epithelial cell line) was exposed to ETEC K88 for 2 hours using transwell culturing system and subsequently stimulated in a cell-cell contact manner with NK-92MI cells pre-treated with L. plantarum for 4 hours. L. plantarum efficiently increased the protein and mRNA levels of NCRs, and the mRNA abundance of IL-10, perforin, INF-ɤ, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-26. In addition, the protein levels of IL-10, LIF and IL-22 were increased by L. plantarum. Protein level of IL-22 was increased in the L. plantarum-treated NK cells supernatant. Transfer of L. plantarum-treated NK cells conferred protection against ETEC K88-induced intestinal epithelial barrier damages in NCM460 cells. Protection was associated with an increased expression of ZO-1 and occludin mRAN and protein in ETEC K88-infected NCM460 cells. Furthermore, adding L. plantarum-treated NK cells to ETEC K88-infected NCM460 cells, the protein and mRNA levels of IL-22R1 was increased in NCM460. L .plantarum-treated NK cells were also observed to induce an augmentation in protein levels of phosphorylated p38, JAK1, Stat3 and Tyk2 in ETEC K88-infected NCM460 cells. L. plantarum-treated NK cells improved intestinal epithelial barrier function via IL-22-IL-22R pathway in NCM460 cells during ETEC-K88 infection.'),\n",

After 14 to 16 d of culture, porcine intestinal enteroids underwent a 24-h LPS challenge (10 μg/mL) to study the localization of TLR4. Control intestinal enteroids showed TLR4 disbursed throughout the cells, whereas localization was more punctate in LPS-treated intestinal enteroids. Co-staining with the early endosome marker early endosome antigen 1 showed increased internalization and colocalization of TLR4 with early endosome antigen 1 after LPS exposure (P = 0.03).

We have begun to develop a system for delivery and expression of a synthetic bGRF gene in cultured bovine cells using the provirus of the bovine leukemia virus (BLV). The gene encoding synthetic bGRF, constructed from eight overlapping oligonucleotides, was fused to the whey acidic protein promoter (WAP) or the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV). These plasmids, termed pWAP.GRF and pMMTV.GRF, were able to induce transcription of bGRF upon transfection into Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells and induction with a lactogenic hormonal milieu (prolactin, hydrocortisone, triiodothyronine, insulin) or dexamethasone. When these constructs were cloned into a BLV vector in place of its oncogenic region, and transfected into MDBK cells, bGRF was expressed. Virus particles were prepared from these cultures and used to deliver the bGRF gene by viral infection into fresh MDBK cells. Northern blot analysis of MDBK total RNA revealed a fivefold higher level of expression of bGRF mRNA in transfected cultures than in virally infected cells, and no expression was detected in control cultures.

This paper provides the first report of the function of Bmi1 in pig intestinal epithelial cells and a brief description of its underlying mechanism. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends technology was used to clone the complete pig Bmi1 sequence, and a Bmi1-pcDNA3.1 vector was constructed for transfection into an intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-1). The proliferation ability of the cells was estimated using the MTT assay and the EdU incorporation method at different time points after seeding. Cell cycle information was detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA abundances of cell cycle-related genes were also measured. The results indicated that the pig Bmi1 cDNA is 3,193 bp in length and consists of a 981 bp open reading frame, a 256 bp 5´ untranslated region (UTR), and a 1,956 bp 3´ UTR. The transcript contains no signal peptides, and there are no transmembrane regions in the pig Bmi1 coded protein, which has a total of 326 AA. The overexpression of the pig Bmi1 in the IPEC-1 cells led to increased cell proliferation and a lower percentage of cells in the G1 and S phases (P &lt; 0.05), along with a higher percentage of cells in the G2 phase (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the gene expression levels of PCNA, Cyclin D1, Cyclin D2, Cyclin B, CDK1, and CDK2 were all elevated (P &lt; 0.05) by Bmi1 overexpression, while the gene expression levels of Cyclin A2 and p21 showed little difference (P &gt; 0.05). Our data suggested that pig Bmi1 can increase the proliferation of IPEC-1 cells by promoting the G1/S transition and the overall cell cycle process.'),\n",

However, previous work with equine satellite cells has suggested distinct species differences in regards to physiological effects and the magnitude of responses to growth factors and regulators. Because there is limited research available regarding the role of leucine in regulating equine skeletal muscle protein synthesis, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of leucine on the mTOR signaling pathway in cultured equine satellite. Protein synthesis was evaluated by measuring the incorporation of [3H] Phenylalanine (3HPhe) in equine satellite cell myotube cultures treated with a leucine titration ranging from 0 to 408 µM. Our results show a 1.8-fold increase (P &lt; 0.02) in protein synthesis at levels slightly greater than those found in the general circulation, 204 and 408 µM when compared to a no leucine control (0 µM). Puromycin incorporation, a nonradioactive surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) methodology, was also measured in cells treated with leucine (LEU; 408 µM), a no-leucine control (CON), and a puromycin-negative vehicle (PURO−). These results demonstrated a 180% increase (P = 0.0056) in puromycin incorporation in LEU compared to CON cultures. To evaluate the mTOR signaling pathway, equine satellite cell myotube cultures were treated with leucine (LEU; 408 µM) or a no-leucine control (CON) in the presence or absence of rapamycin (LR and CR, respectively), an inhibitor of mTOR. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, suppressed phosphorylation of mTOR (P &lt; 0.01) and rS6 (P &lt; 0.01) with an increase in phosphorylation of rS6 in leucine-treated cultures observed when compared to control cultures (P &lt; 0.05). Similarly, there was a 27% increase (P &lt; 0.005) in the hyperphosphorylated γ-form of 4E-BP1 compared to total 4E-BP1 in LEU compared to CON cultures with leucine-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 completely blocked by rapamycin with a smaller decrease observed in CR compared to CON cultures. The major finding of this study was that leucine activated the mTOR translation initiation pathway and increased transcription of global proteins in cultured equine satellite cells. Use of the cell culture system with primary equine muscle cell lines provides the opportunity to distinguish the impact of leucine on muscle and protein synthesis, independent of systemic interactions.')]"

       "  'Pig production is a commodity business, which makes it a cost-driven business. Pig producers and their advisors are appropriately reluctant to adopt technologies without confidence that improved production will more than pay for the cost of the technology. Physiological effects of technologies targeting gut sensory pathways must translate to demonstrably improved health and/or productive performance if they are to be adopted. The types and degrees of stressors experienced by pigs in commercial production vary widely and often differ from those in research herds, and those variations influence their productive responses to nutritional and health technologies. Pigs are most vulnerable to disease soon after weaning, and the diets fed to pigs at that time are more expensive and offered in much smaller amounts than those fed later in life. Those factors make it easier to justify expensive dietary technologies for young pigs than for older ones. New developments in gut chemosensing appear important, but their practical application is not yet clear. We suggest investigation of the potential to connect chemical detection by the gut to pig productivity and/or efficiency through these mechanisms: 1) trophic effects on the intestines, which lead to improved enteric health or enhanced nutrient digestion and absorption, 2) enhanced barrier function in the intestinal mucosa, 3) increased feed intake, 4) enhanced insulin secretion and sensitivity, which may be especially useful in lactating sows to improve subsequent reproduction, and 5) other signals triggered by products of enteric fermentation, possibly short-chain fatty acids, that may influence gut integrity, feed intake, and reproductive function. Each of these mechanisms relates to a practical issue in pig production. Practical application would likely be achieved through dietary changes, but separate management factors, drugs, or other interventions may also be developed.'),\n",

Some of the programs that have been proposed include antibiotic free, organic, non-mammalian, and vegan feeding regimens. These programs are often nebulous in nature, lacking regulatory definitions, and can be subject to changing consumer sentiment. It is imperative for producers to seek clarification of program requirements and evaluate and weigh potential production losses and cost increases against the value generated via niche marketing. Additionally, the value of these programs are often only captured on the higher value cuts of meat while the increased cost is associated with all cuts including offal. To minimize production losses and cost increases begins with an adequate biosecurity and vaccination plan to prevent disease exposure along with the use of nontraditional ingredients to maintain intestinal integrity and positive microbial balance during the critical high stress post-weaning period. Some of these ingredients include prebiotics, probiotics, acidifiers, botanicals, yeast products, enzymes, fermented, isolated, or enzymatically treated soy products, and purified vegetable proteins. With conventional diet matrices and production practices, many of these products game inconsistent and variable responses. However, as we eliminate many of the ingredients that have allowed us to wean younger pigs, the utility of these products may become more necessary.

Limited preemptive knowledge impeded the understanding of PEDV introduction, spread, and prospective economic impacts in the United States. To assess these impacts, this article reviews the timeline of PEDV in the United States and the corresponding impacts. PEDV is a supply-impacting disease and is not demand inhibiting, as pork demand remained strong since PEDV first appeared. Pig losses reached significant levels during September 2013 through August 2014, with the majority of pork production impacts occurring in 2014. PEDV had differing impacts for subsectors of the pork industry. A budget model demonstrates that producers could have had pig losses and decreases in productivity proportionally smaller than price increases, resulting in net returns above what was expected before the major outbreak of PEDV. Previous literature is reviewed to identify the potential main industry beneficiaries of the PEDV outbreaks in the United States. As a result of reduced volumes of available pig and hog supplies, reductions in annual returns likely occurred for packers, processors, distributors, and retailers. In addition, pork consumers who experienced reduced-supply-induced pork-price increases were likely harmed directly by higher prices paid for pork and indirectly as prices of competing meats were also likely strengthened by PEDV. This article also identifies future considerations motivated by the appearance of PEDV in the United States, such as discussions of industry-wide efficiency and competitive advantage, the future role of PEDV vaccines, enhancement in biosecurity measures, and consumer perceptions of food safety and insecurity.'),\n",

The aim of the model is to help pig managers of multisite systems in making short-term decisions (mainly related to pig transfers between farms and batch management in fattening units) and mid-term or long-term decisions (according to company targets and expansion strategy). The model skeleton follows the structure of a three-site system that can be adapted to any multisite system present in the modern pig industry. There are three basic phases, namely, piglet production, rearing pigs, and fattening. Each phase involves a different set of farms; therefore, transportation between farms and delivering of pigs to the abattoir are under consideration. The model maximizes the total gross margin calculated from the income of sales to the abattoir and the production costs over the time horizon considered. Production cost depends on each type of farm involved in the process. Parameters like number of farms per phase and distance, farm capacity, reproduction management policies, feeding and veterinary expenses, and transportation costs are taken into account. The model also provides a schedule of transfers between farms in terms of animals to be transported and number of trucks involved. The use of the model is illustrated with a case study based on a real instance of a company located in Catalonia (Spain).')]"

The final and the only committed step in the biosynthesis of triglycerides is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). The role of DGAT2 in lipid accumulation has been demonstrated in adipocytes, However, little is known about the effect of DGAT2 on the FA composition of these cells.MethodsTo investigate the role of DGAT2 in regulating lipid accumulation, FA composition and the expression of adipogenic genes, we cloned the open reading frame of the porcine DGAT2 gene and established 3T3-L1 cells that overexpressed DGAT2. Cells were then cultured in differentiation medium (DM) without FA, with a mixture of FAs (FA-DM), or containing a 13C stable isotope-labeled FA mixture (IFA-DM). The FA composition of adipocytes was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Quantitative PCR and western blotting were employed to detect expression of adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured with FA-DM for 12 d.ResultsThe triacylglyceride (TAG) content was significantly higher in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells. When cultured in DM or FA-DM for 12 d, cells overexpressing DGAT2 showed a higher proportion of unsaturated FAs (C16:1 and C18:1). However, when cells overexpressing DGAT2 were cultured with FA-DM for 30\\xa0min, the FA composition was almost identical to that of controls. Further, the proportion of stable isotope-labeled FAs were similar in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing DGAT2 and control cells cultured in IFA-DM for 12 d. These results collectively indicate that the higher proportion of mono-unsaturated FAs, C16:1 and C18:1, may originate from de novo FA synthesis but not from the uptake of specific FAs from the medium. This hypothesis is further supported by evidence that both mRNA and protein expression of genes involved in FA synthesis (ACACA, FASN, SCD1, and A-FABP) were significantly higher in cells overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our study revealed that TAG accumulation, the proportion of MUFAs, and the expression of adipogenic genes were higher in 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing DGAT2 than in control cells.'"

In the skeletal muscle, stem cells, called satellite cells, contribute to postnatal muscle growth and hypertrophy, and thus, meat production in agricultural animals. Satellite cells are located adjacent to mature muscle fibers underneath a sheath of basal lamina. Microenvironmental signals from extracellular matrix mediated by the basal lamina and from the host myofiber both impinge on satellite cells to regulate their activity. Furthermore, several types of muscle interstitial cells, including intramuscular preadipocytes and connective tissue fibroblasts, have recently been shown to interact with satellite cells and actively regulate the growth and regeneration of postnatal skeletal muscles. From this regard, interstitial adipogenic cells are not only important for marbling and meat quality, but also represent an additional cellular component of the satellite cell niche. At the molecular level, these interstitial cells may interact with satellite cells through cell surface ligands, such as delta-like 1 homolog (Dlk1) protein whose overexpression is thought to be responsible for muscle hypertrophy in callipyge sheep. In fact, extracellular Dlk1 protein has been shown to promote the myogenic differentiation of satellite cells. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms within the stem cell niche that regulate satellite cell differentiation and maintain muscle homeostasis may lead to promising approaches to optimizing muscle growth and composition, thus improving meat production and quality.'),\n",

       "  'Appearance, distribution, and amount of intramuscular fat (IMF), often referred to as marbling, are highly variable and depend on environmental and genetic factors. On the molecular level, the concerted action of several drivers, including hormones, receptors, transcription factors, etc., determines where clusters of adipocytes arise. Therefore, the aim of future studies remains to identify such factors as biological markers of IMF to increase the ability to identify animals that deposit IMF early in age to increase efficiency of high-quality meat production. In an attempt to unravel the cellular development of marbling, we investigated the abundance of markers for adipogenic differentiation during fattening of cattle and the transcriptome of muscle and dissected IMF. Markers of different stages of adipogenic differentiation are well known from cell culture experiments. They are usually transiently expressed, such as delta-like homolog 1 (DLK1) that is abundant in preadipocytes and absent during differentiation to mature adipocytes. It is even a greater challenge to detect those markers in live animals. Within skeletal muscles, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes can be observed throughout life. Therefore, development of marbling requires, on the cellular level, recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of adipogenic cells to store excess energy in the form of lipids in new cells. In a recent study, we investigated the localization and abundance of early markers of adipogenic differentiation, such as DLK1, in bovine muscle tissue. An inverse relationship between IMF content and number of DLK1-positive cells in bovine muscle was demonstrated. Considering the cellular environment of differentiating adipocytes in muscle and the secretory action of adipocytes and myocytes, it becomes obvious that cross talk between cells via adipokines and myokines may be important for IMF development. Secreted proteins can act on other cells, inhibiting or stimulating their function via autocrine and paracrine actions. Such factors with potential influence on IMF, among them, agouti signaling protein and thrombospondin 4, were identified in transcriptome analyses and further investigated. Furthermore, results from transcriptome analysis indicate involvement of genes that are not directly related to adipogenesis and lipid metabolism, providing new candidates for future research.'),\n",

Neonatal porcine muscle has the potential to yield both cell types for cell culture because it contains developing adipocytes and a high number of muscle satellite cells. Therefore, we modified a conventional collagenase-based procedure to digest neonatal porcine muscle and subsequently cultured the resultant muscle stromal-vascular (SV) cells on several substrata in basal and dexamethasone (DEX)-containing media. Developing myotubes and preadipocytes were present in muscle SV cell cultures on laminin substrata following seeding and plating with fetal bovine serum (FBS) with or without DEX. Myotube number was much higher (P &lt; 0.05) on laminin substrata compared with all other substrata, whereas preadipocyte number in muscle SV cell cultures was independent of substrata, as we have shown previously. This approach can be used to establish co-cultures of differentiating adipocytes and myotubes from collagenase-digested neonatal pig muscle. Because the comparison is within the same culture dish, this method allows for a direct comparison of the responses of adipogenic and myogenic cells to growth and differentiation factors. For example, DEX did not alter myogenesis (i.e., 11 ± 3 vs. 11 ± 4 myotubes per unit area for control and DEX-treated cultures, respectively), but it has been shown to markedly increase preadipocyte number in muscle SV cell cultures.'),\n",

Porcine satellite cells were isolated from RST and WST muscles of 6-wk-old and adult (&gt;6-mo-old) pigs and cultured under standard conditions. Muscle from neonatal pigs yielded nearly 10 times more (P &lt; 0.001) presumptive satellite cells as those from adult pigs, with fusion percentages close to 60% for the former. The RST yielded more (P &lt; 0.001) SC per gram muscle compared to WST, 8.1 ± 0.2 × 104 cells versus 6.7 ± 0.1 × 104 cells/gram muscle in young pigs, and 9.7 ± 0.4 × 103 cells versus 5.5 ± 0.4 × 103 cells/gram muscle in adult pigs, respectively. Likewise, satellite cells from RST proliferated faster (P &lt; 0.001) than those from WST across both ages, as indicated by a shorter cell doubling time, 18.6 ± 0.8 h versus 21.3 ± 0.9 h in young pigs, and 23.2 ± 0.7 h versus 26.7 ± 0.9 h in adult pigs, respectively. As a result of shorter times to confluence, satellite cells from RST also formed myotubes earlier than those SC originating from WST. Once induced, however, SC from WST differentiated and fused faster (P &lt; 0.05) as evidenced by fusion percentage within the first 24 h, 41.6% versus 34.3%, respectively; but reached similar ultimate fusion percentages similar to WST by 48 h. Over 90% of MyHC expressed in maximally fused SC cultures from both RST and WST was restricted to the embryonic isoform. Type IIX MyHC mRNA was not detected in any culture. Myotube cultures from RST expressed more (P &lt; 0.01) Type I MyHC isoform mRNA than those from WST, whereas those cultures from WST expressed more (P &lt; 0.05) Type II (including Types IIA and IIB) MyHC transcripts. These data show SC cultures from porcine fast and slow muscles express MyHC profiles largely reflective of their muscle of origin and suggest satellite cells are partially restricted to a particular muscle phenotype in which they are juxtapositioned. Understanding the molecular nature of these intrinsic control mechanisms may lead to improved strategies for augmenting meat animal growth or muscle regeneration.'),\n",

A growing body of evidence suggests that increased muscle levels of IGF-I and increased muscle satellite cell numbers play a role in anabolic steroid enhanced muscle growth. In contrast to anabolic steroids, the members of the TGF-β-myostatin family suppress muscle growth in vivo and suppress both proliferation and differentiation of cultured myogenic cells.

Therefore, muscle tissue from 6 PI cattle was harvested, refrigerated, frozen, and heated to various internal temperatures. The concentration of virus present was determined by virus isolation. Average cell culture infective doses (50% endpoint; CCID50) of BVDV per gram of frozen, uncooked meat from PI cattle were 105.85 CCID50/g of whole cuts and 106.02 CCID50/g of ground meat.

Vero cells were not permissive to infection with any of 43 different strains of BVDV that readily replicated in Madin Darby bovine kidney cells. In conclusion, this bovine pathogen, which is not considered to be a human pathogen, can be inactivated by cooking ground or whole cuts of meat to 75°C or higher.
